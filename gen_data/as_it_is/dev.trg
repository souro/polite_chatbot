re : idemitsu kosan co ltd anna , i just wanted to confirm with you that all fuel & liquids customers , including those from singapore , are being handled by credit in houston now that the responsibility for global products has moved from london to houston .
so i would appreciate it if you could send a reply confirming that this is the understanding at your end so as to avoid any further confusion .
i spoke with frank davis in houston yesterday about this pa and he agreed that houston pcg would ensure that this customer was reviewed in houston and set up as soon as possible .
i have also confirmed with frank and amita gosalia the situation with regards to responsibilities for japan when processing pas .
it would seem that this is an issue that needs to be discussed further between the london , houston and australia groups to establish responsibilites further .
hopefully this will ensure that this type of confusion does not occur again and delay the processing of a customer application .
i have n't heard anything since & seeing as they appear to be a fuel & oils customer
i apologise for the delay and inconvenience however there was initially some confusion between myself & houston as to where asia pacific fuel & oil customers should be processed .
the database says ' credit reviewing ' - can you please feed back any comments or updates to bo and the london pcg directly ?

the cftc has ruled that in a dealer / customer context , if the customer relies on the dealer 's expertise in entering into a trade , then the trade may be unenforceable against the customer .
in its 1996 lawsuit with bankers trust , procter & gamble unwound an interest rate swap position when they ended up about $ 200 million out of the money .
p&g argued that they were relying on bt due to bt 's superior expertise in interest rate markets , and therefore p&g should n't have to pay .
i will look at and consider any particular language they may wish to propose , but conceptually , we can not trade with counterparties who wish to rely on our market expertise in deciding whether to enter into a trade .

regards philippe proposal for single number range for the new enron campus for the opening of the new enron campus and the changing of the street address from 1400
this single number range would bolster the strategic plan of allocating a did to an employee and that employee can take that number anywhere within the campus in a " plug n play " environment .
the proposal is to take a 70,000 number range to cover current and future requirements .
the benefits are : - less confusion to enron customers and internal users - sufficient numbers to allow enron to expand in the downtown area - increased capacity from one range of numbers to cater for fax or multimedia applications - have a new identity to fall in line with ' '
due to the high utilization of did numbers in the downtown area , we will not get a ( 713 ) area code allocation , and we will be looking at the new ( 832 ) area code .

it seemed like a good idea at the time because the account had dropped pretty dramatically since the previous year , so the taxes looked like a bargain .
it seemed like a good move , given what we knew at the time .
by converting in january , you gave yourself 16 months to prepare to pay the taxes that would be due on the conversion , and you picked a time when the value of your account appeared to be relatively low .
-- those taxes that would have been due next april will vanish .
each year many social security benefit recipients are surprised to learn that part of those payments may be considered as taxable income .
as a result , they could end up having to pay both the unexpected added income tax plus a penalty .
do you expect to make more money next year than this year ?

we feel enron might be willing to sell at a small discount , " the source said .
the government expects a gas deficit to triple in the next six years unless new wells are drilled or existing fields expand sales .
while the fields ' existing output has been fully contracted to the gas authority , the company will negotiate a right to bypass it with additional production , mcmanus said .
mcmanus declined to say whether bg would be interested in buying dabhol .
enron has experienced mixed success as an integrated energy operator in india and is currently attempting to exit the controversial dabhol power project , india 's largest private power plant , of which it has a 65 % controlling stake .
the acquisition depends on some regulatory consents , and on confirmation from eogil joint venture partners to allow it to continue as operator of the fields .
bg said the deal would make it the biggest upstream energy foreign investor in india , with interests in fields that produce 10 percent of the nation 's existing needs and have significant expansion capacity .
enron has been looking to exit the upstream sector in a number of countries worldwide to focus on its core energy marketing and trading skills .
but with delays in the execution of the enron project , rcf also entered into an agreement with tata - total - gail combine for lng supply .
this project too has run into delays with a number of clearances being held up .
meanwhile , the company has announced its plans to go ahead with its expansion plans for the thal unit .
but that is to be expected at the beginning of any business negotiation .
meanwhile , the project , which has interest costs running up to $ 500,000 per day is running up project cost escalation with each delay .
the dpc has already defaulted on its interest payment of $ 20 million for phase ii to over 20 lending institutions on september 17 .
an ncp leader said that the probe seemed ill - timed since the centre too was planning to look into it and several contractual resolution processes were under way .
this stand echoes the fears voiced by the dabhol power company , which has contended that a judicial inquiry at this stage would be a setback to any early resolution of the project since any party interested in a buy - out would rather wait out the inquiry period before deciding to take on enron 's stake of 65 per cent .
enron will also implement a series of energy saving measures at the brewery , including adding energy - efficient boilers and refrigeration units .
measures to improve energy efficiency will help guinness to meet its targets under the climate change levy - a tax levied on corporate energy consumers and individual power plants .

thank you wincenty for choosing network world 's e - mail newsletters .
while waiting for your newsletters to arrive come visit us at http://www.nwfusion.com and be part of networking 's most active online community .
i did n't go back into the office looking for you later in the day .
i will leave them with you and the others do with as you like .
we have the potential to add as much value via govregaffairs activity on the continent in the next 12 months as through any commercial activity .
we should look for local national allies where possible .
we can not be the only voice in any country supporting a major position .
thus , i would agree that probably mid- to long - term he should move on within enron to other hennemeyer sized projects .
but , in the immediate future , he has several very important projects going on in german speaking europe .
additionally , with a new more profound emphasis on getting the gas market opened up , with renewed interest in austria and with the necessity to engage somewhat in switzerland ( regarding transit ) , it does not look to me like we should let paul leave too quickly .
as a somewhat mentor to haizmann , passing off relationships in an orderly manner , ensuring that projects do not fall through the cracks , etc . there is still much for paul to do .
i continue to believe that he would be a very powerful less than 50 % gra front - end for switzerland .
he would be glad to do that but for the next time will clearly keep his commercial focus .
the liberalisation vote next year will fail if it is held .
important to work with gregor and eric to ensure that lars continues to see a variety of opportunities in enron .
i recommend talking with them about him .
i do not see a mid- or long - term role for doug wood on the continent .
in every country where we need to have an impact , the impact must be in local language and should be with a local national .
that will also help ensure that future commercial teams will better understand the role of gra .
besides being expensive and wasteful , this costs a would be analyst a great learning experience .
would be done much more professionally if that were the case and our consulting bills would fall .
) country managers : each country manager ( such as radmacher , renggli , a hopefully soon to be new italian one , etc . ) should be spending a meaningful ( ca . 10 to 15 % ) of their time on gra activities .
the commercial country manager should by definition have the best feel in enron for what we need to do how and with whom in his / her country .
a new market manager such as the future italian country manager should consider gra leadership an essential part of getting their market off of the ground .
if we successfully hire a new italian country manager , he should get heavily involved in this initially .
eventually , we will need a real - live italian in italy but we probably do n't need to look for him / her this quarter .
i can not imagine that we need any resource in former communist europe - poland , czech republic , hungary , slovak republic , etc .
i have a lot of much more minor thoughts and suggestions ; but , i am going to make this my final and conclusive list of gra suggestions .
i look forward to working with you in this regard .
congratulations in you new role and best of wishes .
joe , we 're finalizing our mini - dash for bridgeline and would like to have the latest gas prices .

from houston on tuesday , we 'll bring you an update on < b >

we 'll have live coverage from the conference starting on thursday .
please let me know if you need anything else .
do n't worry , i 'll do the legal work !
just thought i 'd communicate it a little better after i thought about some more .
some of the business folks have asked that i move closer to them .
thursday afternoon would be best for me .
i 'm interested in getting together to discuss westinghouse .
please advise if you have a conflict .
perhaps we can all get on a call and talk to determine how we can best coordinate the various matters .
my experience is that often the confirm and annex issues relate and need to be coordinated together if the counterparty has comments .
by copy to taffy i request that you set up a conference call with greg , tana , mark and myself as soon as our schedules all permit .
i think we might have a misunderstanding on the separation of roles between ecc and ena .
ecc legal will do the legal work in assisting the calgary confirm desk in preparing the actual confirms , amendments , terminations , etc .
perhaps mark taylor can clarify on these points .
please help us with our market research class !
we would appreciate your input into a market research survey that we are conducting as part of a class at the haas school of business at uc berkeley .

you wo n't be able to reach me at this email address and the work numbers below much longer , as adaptive broadband has filed for bankruptcy .

i will be checking the phone and email at work infrequently , and the new contact information is a better way to get in touch with me .
i 'll send another note when i have a new job .
hopefully this provides what you are looking for , however , there is more to come .
please note the fourth paragraph requesting the total labor and expenses for the " big picture " .

i am out of town until friday , but we do plan on meeting friday afternoon , i will respond on any additional information outstanding .

elliott overscope of repairs associated with some of the above items , misalignment and other items noted in my e - mail of 1/24 ( including work completed on units # 2 & # 3 ) .
if the meeting this friday takes place , i will respond as fully as possible to the claim next week based on documentation we have received to date .
i really appreciate your going out of your?way to help .
( 2 ) i can be of more assistance in the future if , instead of telling keegan you need a file , that you contact me directly .
that way , i can make sure that you get what you need .
that way we do not have to put the burden on keegan to locate my files -- although i am sure she is more than willing to help , i do not think she knows much about where i keep particular files or documents .
if i were getting treatment across the street from the office , i still could be here to do any work .
keegan was immediately advised if we needed a file that could not be located .
may be you would wish to do this as you see fit ......
look forward to seeing you soon in a week or so ...
marked up with my suggested changes from an english law perspective .
as i mentioned to you yesterday , these documents will also need to be considered by the overseas lawyers to see whether there are any overriding local laws which could impact on the use .
it is also worth bearing in mind that a counterparty may ask for the eta at the time of entering into the itaa or may be relunctant to click through the eta until they have had internal legal sign off .
nonetheless , i understand that you are keen to proceed with signing the itaa off line and the eta on line and accordingly , the attached documents are marked up with that structure in mind .
i have the following brief comments on the changes i have made : 1 .
i note from your e - mail yesterday that it was suggested that we need to list the affiliates or have one entity enter into the transactions .
i think there may be some confusion here .
the website will need to be set up in such a way as to achieve this
but i assume that this causes no problem as each counterparty will see different pages on the website depending on what password has been inserted .
on reflection , it will be more appropriate for relevant data protection wording to be on the website itself rather than in the itaa or eta .
before providing appropriate wording for this , could you please let me know what information will be collected by you concerning living individuals either intentionally or unintentionally .
for example , when a password is entered will you be able to identify a living individual by this or can you intentionally or unintentionally obtain that individual 's e - mail address or other information on them once they have entered the site .
you will need to check this with your technical people .
once you have had a chance to review this perhaps you could let me have your comments .
they may have further comments which we will send onto you as a matter of urgency .
if you have any questions , please give me a call .
cooperatieve centrale raiffeisen - boerenleenbank b.a. the opinion will include the typical opinion that to the opinor 's knowledge , no action , proceeding etc . should affect the ability of ena to perform under the swap .

hi vince , the following has been organised for you : sunday 6.45pm dinner at diverso restaurant 85
as we discussed , i have been working with a counterparty interested in purchasing one or both of ena 's illinois development project llc 's .
the transaction would be an outright purchase of 100 % of the member interests in one or both of the following project entities : kendall new century development , l.l.c. titan land development company , l.l.c. 2 .
i have received a letter from pseg power llc indicating their interest in proceeding with a transaction in the near future .
i will forward you a copy of this letter for your records .
i will be in chicago tomorrow .
there may be some credit issues going forward , however while we have the exelon corp. guaranty in place in its current form , we do not have any credit issues insofar as they relate to physical power trading .
however , in the interim , we will need to clearly identify , at an operational level , with whom we are trading .
this is not to be taken as , and is not a consent by epmi to any such assignment or assumption , but solely a suggested way forward in the short term to ensure clarity in any dealings between the new legal entity that is exelon and epmi kind regards , marcus

burstein sees the current situation as analogous to the savings - and - loan crisis and the great real - estate collapse of the late 1980s to early 1990s .

pervasive computing means that new appliances , new security systems , new hvac installations in buildings , whether commercial or residential , will communicate with server farms to exchange information constantly .
so it 's not surprising that major investment houses are scouring the countryside , looking at internet - infrastructure companies that will enable the coming of all of these new technologies .
but after 18 months of virtually no activity , with huge pools of investment money sitting on the sidelines in cash accounts , the great game has quietly restarted .

starting compensation packages range from $ 88,000 to $ 110,000 -- lower than those that investment banks and consulting companies offer new m.b.a. hires , which can run as high as $ 145,000 .
it 's a possibility that has m.b.a.s excited .
they say the frenzy is fed both by the likelihood that money will be tougher to raise under new rules , and by an election season in which just a few races could tip party control in the house or senate or both .
much of the current money drive is complicated by the lack of certainty surrounding future reforms .
party officials said they are unsure of when the law will take effect and whether they will still be able to use donations already collected .
the union would have created the largest electric utility in the u.s. , with 6.3 million customers and more than 48,000 megawatts of generating capacity .

the project is expected to generate about 100 kilowatts of electricity - enough for about 65 homes - by july .
we would love to be able to engineer and design these things so we could do them at smaller and smaller dairies over time , " said jeff cole , pge ' ; biogas program manger .
pge officials also are interested in developing a 4.5 megawatt , methane - powered energy facility in morrow county that could provide energy for about 3,000 homes .
it would depend on manure from dairies relocating to the area to support a tillamook county creamery association cheese plant .
agl announced after close of trade yesterday that the new south wales government had agreed to a shake - up which would lift a current five per cent share ownership cap .
at least one analyst predicted the lifting of the cap would leave agl open to potential takeovers .
agl could well be a takeover target as the global economy picks up and the big utilities start to expand , " a bnp paribas analyst said in a report today .
analysts were now looking out for separate plans by agl to spin - off its network assets , with speculation an announcement may be forthcoming as early as next week .
after a great two - year run for the energy stocks , a lot of investors are wondering what to do about the sector .
a price- or earnings - momentum investor could make a very good case that the energy sector is due for a short - term correction and it 's time to sell out of highfliers like weatherford international ( wft ) and enron ( ene ) .
a long - term value investor , on the other hand , might continue to see a buying opportunity in stocks like transocean sedco forex ( rig ) and apache ( apa ) based on both historically low price multiples and the possibility of consolidation .
the high prices that energy producers currently enjoy help contribute to economic slowdown .
but i also believe it will be short lived .
over the longer term , factors propping up global demand will remain in place , and that should keep upward pressure on stock prices .
new era seldom tops the charts among natural - resource funds , since it has a true diversified natural - resource objective .
even if opec could produce more , we probably could n't transport it here , " he says , citing limited shipping and refining capacity .
as a result , you 'd expect a global recession to spell trouble for most of these stocks .
and that should spell good things for this group , short - term correction or no .

thought you guys might appreciate this most powerful women in business :
may be good for consumers but hinder new production
in the wake of last month 's terrorist attacks , natural - gas prices have slid below $ 2 per million british thermal units , frustrating any hopes that prices will rebound this year to levels that would encourage more investment in natural - gas projects .
analysts predict that with prices at current levels , projects to bring more liquefied natural gas into the u.s. could be shelved or canceled .
at $ 2 per million btus and below , producers have a hard time justifying exploration and new production .
the coast guard and department of transportation are studying concerns that a lng tanker could become a bomb for terrorists .
already , relative to other areas , natural - gas prices have inched higher in new england , where natural - gas pipeline constraints have long hampered the market .
while prices that are close to historical levels are good for consumers , such low prices could scare many producers away from making investments to ensure future natural - gas demand is met .
even with the increased natural - gas drilling of earlier this year , overall natural - gas supply is expected to increase just 1 % this year , as the country 's mature wells continue to be depleted faster than companies can replace them .
the tight supply picture has analysts optimistic that prices will rebound next year amid lower interest rates , increased defense and relief spending and returning consumer confidence .
a spokeswoman for el paso , houston , says the company is moving forward with at least three terminals for the u.s. market .
enron said it is also pushing ahead with a terminal in the bahamas that would pipe the gas to florida starting in 2004 .
after months of scouting for a buyer for its one lakh square feet office space at wockhardt towers in bandra - kurla complex , enron has been able lease out 10,000 square feet of it to citibank na .
property consultants say that if enron manages to lease out the entire four floors , it will be easier for it to sell the property to a buyer , as the buyer would be assured of a fixed income .
a leading consultant said that it has been difficult to find any buyers for such a large property .
most international buyers prefer to take property on lease instead of an outright purchase , " he added .
inside a stodgy utility , southern , fuller built a high - growth trading and marketing unit , which was spun off in april .

dear ken , i 'd like to thank you for your continued participation in this project .
i thought it would make sense to quickly recap where we are following last week 's meeting .
we will , for example , express a greater appreciation for the fact that there are major problems with the current financial reporting framework , a big gap between gaap and the real world in which investors must make their judgements .
we will elaborate on the issue of the environment for disclosure , suggesting that we need a way of thinking about the concept of safe harbor , one which is based on the notion that the way to protect investors amid so much uncertainty is to make it easier for companies to provide forward looking information , knowing that no one can be fully confident of any projections these days .
we will be much bolder in recommending several groups - the sec , fasb , institutional investors - take a much greater interest in the deficiencies of the reporting model and ask the questions , commission the studies , etc .
i 'd suggest no more than one page , preferably half a page .
john neff may wish to express skepticism about the value of developing a new language for intangibles .

it can be accessed at www.epa.gov/mercury it will likely take some time for epa to develop these regulations -- the time frame is proposed rule by 2003 and final rule by 2004 -- but this is a significant step in that it now formally puts mercury on the radar screen for power generators , in terms of planning for emissions controls .
it also means that mercury will most likely be included in any efforts to develop " multi - pollutant " legislation in the next congress .
exposure to mercury has been associated with both neurological and developmental damage in humans .
epa will propose regulations by december 2003 and will begin developing those regulations shortly .
i will be in all next week if we need to further tweak the language .

i hope you will forward this to the appropriate person in your company to take advantage of this program - and to help our state avoid rolling blackouts this summer .
the governor has proposed a new solar credit for the purchase and installation of solar energy systems between 10 kw and 200 kw for the 2001 through 2003 tax years .
this program will pay customers a monthly reservation payment of $ 20,000/mw / month to be available on weekdays between 11:00 am and 7:00 pm from june 1 through september 30 to curtail at iso request , and will additionally receive $ 500/mwh for curtailed demand .
businesses with loads over 200 kw per month will receive meters that will enable them to better track and manage their energy use and participate in demand reduction programs .
grants will be awarded to businesses for efficiency projects including , but not limited to , lighting and cooling efficiency improvements , solar cooling , building energy management controls , electric generation from landfill gas , and solar systems .

fear of a rally to be sure , some power - plant operators may be wary of switching back to gas because of the chances for a rally this summer , said tim evans , senior energy analyst at ifr pegasus in new york .
adding to that demand , gas - fired power plants with about 25,000 megawatts of capacity are expected to start up this summer , according to a u.s. energy department report published last month .

aquila 's pending ipo looks strong by will mcnamara director ,
in raising the high end of the price range , aquila could raise up to $ 380 million ( compared to a previous $ 363 million ) .
in addition to a recently completed merger with st. joseph light & power company , utilicorp has been planning the spin - off of the highly successful aquila subsidiary for some time .
aquila is scheduled to debut on the new york stock exchange under the symbol " ila " the week of april 23 .
consequently , the most practical way to maximize shareholder interest and boost stock value is for utilicorp to bifurcate its operations , offering two options for capital investment .
however , the real emphasis coming from the company seems to be clearly placed on aquila , an aggressive and ambitious energy operation that i project will dramatically expand its trading and telecom ( bandwidth ) operations over the next year .
the ipo of aquila should elevate its stature considerably , as new funding opportunities should enable the company to expand its scope into new markets .

i will continue to freak out myself .
may 21st - check in with you -- at that time if i have decided against making the change , we will begin to discuss reshaping my responsibilities .
otherwise , we will proceed with the following .
( i would expect to be open to do some limited travel -- it would depend on the attendance policies of the professors )
i know lindy has some clear ideas on what we want here ... we can discuss more if you like .
as of now , everyone has said that they will participate - please let me know if you ca n't make it - prior to noon tomorrow
he might be interested because there is so much at stake and it is so high profile .
we could pitch it to him that we 'll provide the back up , if you want .
confidentially , we will be opening a nyc office by sept , and are negotiating with foster about his joining us .
i could put you in touch with some general counsel who think very highly of him .
again , we could provide coordination and back up if you like .
of course there would be value in maintaining consistency of positions in new york and california , less learning curve , etc .
> > i anticipate that enron may have some legal issues in new york similar to the issues enron has faced in california .
the list is still a work in progress , therefore , if you see anything that i might be missing or appears to be incorrect - please let me know .
we will migrate these new changes to production ( www.hottap.enron.com ) on next monday night , and i will send a confirmation email out when it is done .
this looks good from the commercial side .
otherwise , this is what we are looking for as far as viewing this spreadsheet on line .
when the formatting issues are resolved , i recommend we move this to production .
we may need to look at another format to cover the on - line users and the customers that print this report .
my suggestion is lets try look at another format that will cover both sides ( printing and viewing ) .
we only wish we 'd bought our other favorite drooy as well .
yesterday , i also pointed out the potential for both weakness and a potential reversal if we got that weakness early in the week .
we got it , so now i have to look for a bounce .
this indicator can tell us a lot about the flow of money .
the arms index went out at 2.53 today , and i 've learned from experience to expect at least a one day bounce when that happens .
mutual funds do n't have that much cash on hand , either , and if redemptions begin to rise , they could be in deep trouble .
do n't get too bearish , but be alert for the worse case scenario to develop over the coming weeks .
as mis administrator for your organization , you must confirm via email that this person is eligible for the digital certificate applied for as soon as possible .
we appreciate your assistance in this matter .
dear real time , please be advised that i have entered the following annuity to your books ( please see notes on deal for details ) :
based on your quick feedback , we will send execution documents electronically so janet can initial .
if possible , i would like for you to sit down with lindy and a few folks from our group who have been looking at this .
i want to make sure that it would be an efficient use of your time and that we would not be duplicating anything .
i will have lindy contact you so we can set something up and then move forward as necessary .
- i worked it out so you will be getting the lowest possible rate for my time ,
i would like to send you an engagement letter this week for up to 3 weeks or 120 hours ( $ 21k ) .
i think we can get it done in less time but the 120 hours provides some flexibility if we decide to go deeper on something -- we would only charge you for the hours we use .
to the extent time allows , i will be able to help negotiate and close whatever option you choose .
in order for me to offer our preferred rate , it is important to note that i would need to be able to do this project on somewhat of a flexible basis ( e.g. friday meetings , emails , and phone vs. being on - site 3 weeks full - time ) .
even with this flexible structure , i feel confident that we can have the deliverable complete by mid december .
as for the new idea ---- i have been spending much of my time lately helping merchant power generators think about ways to leverage the value of their asset position / market intelligence .
these " events " would be studied in the follow way - 1 .
for those events that have a strong correlations , develop a trading strategy around the relationship .
secondary benefits of this risk management ( trading ) strategy , would be developing the expertise to make decisions related to benefits of selling the capacity physical vs. through basis derivatives .
steve , if you are interested in this idea i can start drawing up a workplan for this study .
if your team is available i could come by next friday mid - morning or later to start discussing with them .
on the administrative side , i am working to nail down the lowest hourly rate i can get for you .
this amount of time should be adequate to put together a short study on your different options .
a quick update - i moved over from ees to accenture 's energy group about six months ago and have been focusing on trading and risk management & pipeline optimization projects .
i had an idea which i thought you might find interesting .
i am currently pursuing another project with ben asante , so i am around the enron building .
let me know if you would like to get together to discuss further .
thank you so muck for taking > them .....
i2 expressed considerable interest in the opportunity below the executive level , but enw had difficulty getting a concrete bid or proposal from i2 .
i2 's response to the enron offer was that they considered it high and that they would prefer to partner with enron in some manner in addition to some form of purchase .
since those early discussions with i2 , enw has discussed the enrononline opportunity with other selected technology companies , and is now considering bids from several potential counterparties .
generally speaking the deal structure that appears to provide the best opportunity for both parties entails involvement by enw after the transaction , in the form of equity participation or royalty payments or both , as well as the transfer of some enron people .
this seems to move us into the realm of a " partnership " structure that could fit the initial i2 interest .
we want to make sure we give i2 the opportunity to outline a proposal with a price as well as outline their needs for a relationship going forward , or to confirm that they are not interested .
enron remains interested in exploring this opportunity with i2 if there is a genuine interest from i2 . 2 .
enron is moving down the path with other parties , so if i2 has an interest , we would need to start working with them soon .
thank you for your assistance on this .
please let us know if you need more information .
hi , cooper thank you for your order .
we feel this is in the best interest of the customer ,
the new york 780 3rd ave office is closed and has been inventoried .
chicago , montreal and toronto include some mg people and i am hoping to have some clarity on these locations early in the new year .
apx will keep you posted after we have an opportunity to review the order .
in regard to sending index prices via e - mail , i think it will be a lot more efficient for everyone involved to do it this way .
hello kate , thank your so much for everything .
again , thank you and feel free to call me if you have any further questions / concerns .
if you 'd like me to start e - mailing instead of faxing the prices i will begin entering the counterparty names as well .
please note that i have added some guaranty / ld provisions in exhibit a , and confirm whether these are appropriate in scope and amount .
RE: Meeting you would be interested in
thanks for the update on project ranger , this is extremely informative .
meeting you would be interested in i am forwarding emails relevant to the team ranger initiative from the time i became involved to the time the scope of the effort was limited .
since i had been discussing my forecasting data needs and rps tie - ins with scott , he viewed this as an opportunity for the organization to gather more information than strictly needed to meet this objective and invited me to lobby for an expanded scope .
clearly i was outvoted , since the subsequent scope was severely restricted to retrieving only the financial data that is readily available to csc and which will enable flash report development quickly ( for power only ) ; an expanded scope would have compromised timely deliverables .
if you are interested in attending , please do so .
after looking at this , a couple of thoughts : assuming that we will create a " global " repository that will support everyone 's needs for all ees activity ( purchases and sells )
we should be able to use the gcp / ees settlement system cross reference mapping that is set up and maintained by global counterparty as a way to get to enron 's global counterparty number
this should be a daily feed we will need the same information for payments additional information needed in the file :
i will have christina schedule a meeting for further discussion .
csc has already submitted an impact statement for this work ; however , if it would assist any of your efforts to use , expand , or modify this data extract , i believe it would be beneficial to discuss it before we move forward with this project .
please let patrick or myself know if you have any questions regarding this .
after meeting with other department heads , team ranger has been expanded .
the team members assigned to each phase and the groups they represent initial due date of project deliverables please review this document .
if you have not been notified that you will participate on this team , please see your supervisor .
glenn matthys will be contacting those individuals to set up our first meeting ..... probably tomorrow .
thank you in advance for your cooperation !
this can be used to ' jump start ' our first meeting(s ) and to assist in creating our new project plan .
below is an attachment with additional data item input from mike frazier who needs data for volume forecasting .
pat first , i 'm sorry about the tardiness .
attached is the file you sent me with data elements that are important in volume forecasting highlighted and copied into its own column , then supplemented with additional information that would be useful if available from the sources contemplated .
thanks , pat , for your help in compiling this list .
good morning all , cheryl has called to say that she is feeling a little under the weather this morning , but will be working from home and is available

if you should need further assistance , please feel free to contact me directly .
like the earlier incidents in seattle , large - scale clashes between demonstrators and police are expected .

we asked our geophysicists for help and are shooting for a meeting on thursday to run our ideas by them .
i observed that there is an opportunity to get in the early steps of the ( oil exploration ) energy supply chain - we can get at the key data driving oil drilling earlier than anyone else by extending into this area of broadband networking - to build a way to hedge oil and other energy trades .
i asked adler or reichardt to present the idea to your team for validation .
i 'm converting to consultant - i 've had a great year here but need to get back north more often ( family ) .

the discrepancy can be traced to differences in input variables of the two models and not to any algorithmic differences .
should these price increases prove to be sustainable , we would expect to see a meaningful improvement in investor sentiment .
recently there has been increasing speculation that a chapter 11 bankruptcy filing by southern california edison , the utility subsidiary of edison international , could be imminent .
we thought it would be timely to analyze the implications of an sce bankruptcy for the ipps .
such an event would have no impact on the earnings estimates or forecasted growth rates for any of the companies under our coverage .
beyond giving a detailed review of the business , we expect management to discuss the prospect of future acquisitions .
recently , management has indicated that it is evaluating a number of potential transactions located primarily in the southeast .
we also expect the company to provide a detailed regulatory update on its key markets - pjm and ny .
finally , we expect management to reaffirm prior guidance for 2001 of $ 1.15 per share .
while we believe orn 's exposure to the new york city market offers meaningful upside potential , we believe the company will continue with its conservative stance for the year .

q2 earnings report looks very good !
kinder morgan transfers $ 300 m in assets to mlp kinder morgan , inc. announced plans to contribute $ 300 million in assets to kinder morgan energy partners , l.p. , the company 's master limited partnership .
it is expected to be accretive to cash available for distribution to kmp 's unitholders by between 5 - 10 cents in 2001 .
the pipeline assets are a good fit for kmp because they complement existing kmp assets , have long - term contracts in place and offer significant growth opportunities .
kmi will also benefit from the transaction , as it will be able to reduce its debt by $ 150 million , " kinder said .
by increasing its stake in the master limited partnership , kmi will enjoy greater participation in the expected future growth of kmp .
in addition , this transaction will boost kmi 's total asset contribution to kmp to more than $ 1 billion , far exceeding the original goal stipulated when kinder morgan merged with kn energy last july .
tara and i will be here early in the morning to monitor the bridge and make sure the physical deals are bridging correctly .

i will also be faxing this section to your home .
thanks for your voice mail indicating that we have received the faxed version of citigroup 's signed nda .
i appreciate your help on putting this nda to bed .
depending upon the water year for 2002 the rates will more than likely go back down in 6 - 12 months .
until this past year and the shortages in california , bpa could meet their increased demand on the spot markets , but with prices contorted because of ca , acquiring power on the spot has been prohibitive , so we have everyone becoming attentive to the problems in the west .
it would seem that we could work around them somehow , because they already have a special status as direct retail customers of bpa .
we need to have both the customer and the utility benefit from the deal if this is really going to work .
you may have already done this , but we need to develop a solid response to bpa 's criticism of the negawatt proposal -
given that bpa is short , this type of proposal makes perfect sense ( from a bpa only perspective and from a west wide perspective - if enough load comes off , any remaining short that bpa must fill would be at a lower price ) .
thanks for keeping me posted on the prc meeting .
i will make travel plans for the afternoon of december 13th accordingly .

i think full time employment starting in about six months seems to be the best option .
and i think the telecom market that enron is entering is very interesting and very lucrative .
i would be very interested in working in that segment for enron .
so while i am definitely interested , the start date will probably have to be around that time .
hopefully once i have defended my dissertation we can discuss employment oppurtunities in greater detail .
you can change in any way you see fit ...
give me a call if you want to discuss
and if there is anything else required from me , please advise .

alternateively , individual core aggregators may prefer to proceed on their own .
i estimate that the fees for an outside expert witness to testify on the above - referenced matters would be approximately $ 9,900 .
our group should discuss , at the earliest possible time , how to proceed with the presentation of prepared testimony .
thank you for your attention to his request .
please check with cindy - thanks .

el paso says it 's open to expansion of system el paso natural gas " is willing to expand its system " to the california border if " sufficient support " for such a project can be demonstrated through long - term capacity contracts , the pipeline told ferc .
the pipeline 's comments were in response to a commission inquiry asking el paso to consider the feasibility of upgrading its proposed line 2000 crude - oil conversion project to a system expansion to help ease the pipeline capacity crunch in the west .
daniel m. adamson , director of ferc 's office of energy projects , raised the prospect in a jan. 3 letter to el paso , saying that modifying the project " could assist the difficult situation " now facing the california gas market .
el paso proposed the line 2000 project as a loop line to replace existing compression , and not as a system expansion .
however , " there are several ways that an expansion could be accomplished , " wrote el paso vice president al clark on jan. 15 .
el paso could add compression to the proposed line 2000 project , or it could replace or recommission the compression that the pending application proposes to abandon in place .
as a third option , he said el paso could add new compression to its existing system or loop either the existing system or line 2000 project .
the " preferable method will have to be determined by a careful analysis of the relative costs and a determination of where shippers want the capacity , i.e. where they want to put gas into el paso 's system and where they want the gas delivered , " clark said .
as a " first step " towards gauging market support for an expansion , he noted that el paso on jan. 12 posted 1.2 bcf / d of california - bound pipeline capacity for sale effective june 1 of this year .
when the posting results are known , " el paso will determine whether another open season is needed to solicit expressions of interest in additional pipeline capacity to serve markets both into and upstream of california .
if el paso finds there is an " unmet demand for additional capacity " on its system , the pipeline at that time " will evaluate whether an expansion of the existing system or a modification of the line 2000 project , or both , is the appropriate means of accomplishing the expansion , " clark noted .
not only will the project " increase the operational flexibility " of el paso 's current system , but converting the line from oil to gas service will be a " necessary prerequisite " to any future expansion of the pipeline 's system , according to clark .

the deal , originally valued at over $ 4 billion , had been in trouble for months , and each side sued the other in state court in new york .
pnm said the merger could be terminated after dec. 31 under the terms of the deal , if there had not been satisfactory progress made towards completing the transaction .
the enron portion would thus be $ 49,708,938 .
i will nominate tentative date for april and may which we can revise next month .

davis said his proposed rate plan is sufficient to help reduce the $ 13-billion debt of southern california edison and pacific gas & electric .
perhaps adding to the urgency , utility customers could start seeing increases in their bills as early as next month .
further raising the stakes for the speech , davis warned this week that supplies will be so short that there could be blackouts by the end of the month , and continue into may and june .
there is a concern for the future .
i do n't think people are looking for a magic wand .
the delay raises questions about whether the conservation incentives will be in place long enough to have an immediate effect .
standard & poor 's said it is unlikely that southern california edison and pacific gas & electric will regain a sound credit rating soon .

according to todd peterson of enron global lng , exploitation of this opportunity has been the topic of some industry articles but no one , as far as we know , has constructed such a vessel .

attached is a link to a relatively brief description of the proposed vessel , please let me know if any further research is needed .

on october 23 , commissioner wood issued a ruling asking for public input on direct access contracts , noting that commencing on or about july 1 , 2001 , there has been an increase in customers switching to direct access .
this is a particularly onerous provision for manufacturers who have a long history of temporarily shutting plants down for a week over such holidays as thanksgiving , christmas , and new year 's day .
the board will entertain further discussion on the draft plan at a november 7 workshop .

let me know if we have any questions , thanks , mark x33396
but i do n't know if the credit decision can be made until that part is sorted out .
we do need to capture the activity related to dsm in the ees dpr ( including some portion of credit reserve and drift ) but until we have the system capability to capture this it may just have to be part of the whole whees bucket .
reflecting the positions on the whees dpr will make them consistent with how we are capturing them from an accounting perspective .
if there are no objections i would recommend moving the credit reserve over at the next possible point .
this thinking only reflects how things are currently contemplated , if the mix around what is with ews vs. ees ( i.e. , accounts receivable ) we may want to rethink the credit reserve portion .
i 'd like to make an announcement .
i hope you got a good deal on my wine table .
thanks for the address - i bought your wine table from gerald ( who had squatters right on it and could legally sell it to me - he 's an attorney , remember ) .

overall , pg & e 's national energy group has 30 power plants in 10 states , and others under development or construction that include one in athens , n.y. , that is expected to begin supplying electricity to new york city in 2003 .
it looked like the utility opportunity was going to start shrinking , ' '
nevertheless , scottish power has said it intends to expand further in the u.s. to exploit opportunities for merger cost savings in a highly fragmented market .
` ` it 's hard to see them finding a better company to buy in terms of geographic fit and potential cost savings , ' ' said peter atherton of schroder salomon smith barney , who released a note last week pointing out the opportunity .
sentiment continued to be boosted by hopes that the strong u.s. first quarter gdp may signal that the u.s. economy will avoid a recession , dealers added .
jones)- u.k. integrated utility scottish power plc 's ( spi ) reported bid for u.s. utility portland general would be a good fit for the u.k. company and could be accomplished without increasing its debt burden , analysts said monday .
they would be silly not to be looking at it , " said another analyst at a large london investment bank .
nevertheless , the company has said it hopes to take advantage of electricity shortages in the region once its problems with hunter are resolved , and that it hopes to ultimately make further acquisitions .
expressing confidence that the issue would be resolved soon , goenka said even if enron decides to pull out it will have no impact on private investment in the sector .
investments will come only if investors are confident of getting viable returns .
i think we have been helpful with a lot of the governments in terms of rationalizing the power issue .
i do n't think we have a magic formula for regional contracting , " said wolfensohn , adding " but i would say it has come into prominence more in recent years on both negotiation of contracts and on the establishment of pricing .
so , ( thanks to public opinion ) it is correcting itself .
indeed , the plans for disinvesment are being viewed as a powerful trigger that can send its stock price soaring .
after weathering stormy waters in the past few years , the shipping industry seems ready to chart higher growth in calmer climate propelled by higher freight rates .
this definitely helps them improve profits and cash flows , " says deepak agrawal , analyst at kotakstreet.com .
the restructuring moves are having a positive impact on the company , " says agarwal .
the international maritime organisation ( imo ) regulations could see the supply of tankers coming under slight pressure , " agrees agrawal .
one opportunity that experts forecast will be a revenue - grosser for the indian shipping industry in the coming years , is the budding demand for natural gas .
it has also formed a joint venture with us energy giant enron corp and mitsui for a vessel to transport lng from the middle east to enron 's subsidiary dabhol power company by the end of 2001 .
besides , in a bid to strengthen fleet size , sci has also placed orders worth rs 823 crore to build four aframax tankers in south korea and an lr2 tanker in cochin .
the committee 's report notes , " the exact terms need to be agreed between the contracting parties , but , in the committee 's opinion , unless the negotiations proceed on these broad guidelines and various parties make concessions of this magnitude , the ultimate result is likely to be as infructuous as the earlier renegotiations in 1995 .
` ` wind is the great energy success story of the last decade , ' ' says roderick bridge , an analyst at hsbc investment bank in london .
the u.s. could have played a bigger role .
wise technology choices helped the danes build on the generous government support .
larger 2.5- and 3-megawatt machines are under development -- some of them destined for offshore environments where the wind is reliable but storms , waves , and salty conditions
and improvements in computerized control systems are helping turbines squeeze out more watts from the wind more efficiently .
since the gearbox is often a source of trouble , abb 's gearless device could make a big splash in the market .
wind power may look like an anachronism .

both received high marks for their students ' teamwork strengths and analytical and problem - solving skills .
each school was ranked on 27 factors that influence a recruiter 's decision to visit a particular campus and hire a particular graduate , such as the career - services office , the core curriculum and students ' leadership potential and teamwork skills .
recruiters complained that graduates of some of the most prominent schools expect too much too soon in terms of salary and position and are difficult to retain for very long .
what school is best depends on the recruiters ' needs , " says recruiter laura barker morse , at venture - capital firm atlas venture .
we want to be helpful to our fast- growing companies .
jeff puzas , a manager at the consulting firm prtm in washington , d.c. , has recruited at both harvard and carnegie mellon and believes carnegie mellon has the edge in analytical and technical skills while graduates of harvard excel in interpersonal communication .
as one survey respondent remarks about switzerland 's imd , there 's " a real focus on getting students a great job that is a really good fit .
but we find time and time again better - prepared students at the small schools ; they 're less theoretical , more hands - on , " she says .
they also seem more team - oriented , and it 's critically important that you can rely on every member of the team in a start - up like mine .
we are more likely to find a candidate at a school with a larger class size , particularly if there are a large number of recruiters .

we did n't have a good fall season at m.i.t. and were n't at all pleased with the results , " ms. gandy says .

there 's just a good chance that the conversation wo n't be about planes .
more significant , it needs to get into less cyclical , higher - margin businesses , like aircraft maintenance .
theoretically , at least , the internet will make doing all this easier ; in other cases , it will make it possible .
then , failure could be repositioned as a " learning experience .
the net has been with us long enough that a handful of lessons are emerging .
sure the company liked to think it knew more about building planes than anyone in the world , but good luck trying to get your hands on that information after the planes were built .
a big chunk of the work is finished , but there 's still more to do .
right now , if you wanted to look inside boeing to see if another division had manufactured a part with the specs you needed , you ca n't do that , " says cio scott griffin .
digitizing the data is already helping to solve the problems .
eventually , as boeing goes down this road , webifying the company will help ease entry into new lines of business and increase sales .
standardizing and reducing the number of parts has helped boost margins on plane - building to 9 % from 5 % in 1999 .
the ultimate payoff for boeing could be huge .
the hope was that the system would automatically take payments , deliver the shoes , and , when supplies dropped , notify the manufacturers in asia .

but starting small helps his team understand the pitfalls of the business without too much risk .

to invest $ 50 m enron corp. , the us energy major , in a major diversification measure , has decided to make internet services its main source of revenue in the country .
the platform 's three decks provide more than 4 acres of living and working space as it taps the more than 400 million barrels of oil and gas trapped in two adjacent fields 4,800 feet below .
` ` for instance , if you wanted an exploration company and were willing to do the research and trade often , you 'd be better off with eog , apache corp. , or devon energy .
but if you 're just looking for a big company , exxon mobil is the bellwether . '
he counters by pointing to the contributions that big projects like the hoover and diana fields will make down the line :
at current prices , that translates into more than $ 1 billion of sales a year .
new technology is integral to the cost - cutting effort .
exxon mobil spends more than $ 500 million a year developing proprietary technology for everything from stronger steel so pipelines can take gas out of remote places like alaska to platform designs for fields deeper than hoover and diana .
` ` a bad investment decision could be around for more than 20 years , ' ' he said .
raymond 's been applying his brand of frugality at exxon since joining the company as a production research engineer in tulsa , oklahoma , in 1963 , soon after receiving a ph.d. in chemical engineering from the university of minnesota .
the company hoped to profit from technological developments contained in an energy - saving device for electric motors ; the technology eventually proved to be commercially unfeasible .
` ` if you 're the most efficient competitor on a large scale , then it 's axiomatic in my mind that you 're going to end up over time with a very sound financial result and a very strong cash flow and a high return on capital employed , which is what the objective of exxon mobil is , ' ' raymond said .
the new structure is designed to promote new ideas across old boundaries .
this could take up to a day if the engineer was in the field .
efficient deepwater drilling efficient deepwater drilling will be crucial to the company 's financial future .
next year , the company plans to tap two fields near hoover and diana , called marshall and madison , that hold another 47 million barrels , moving the company toward an ambitious goal of boosting worldwide production 3 percent a year through 2005 .
balance sheet in good shape because exxon mobil 's balance sheet is in good shape , it can focus on finding other things besides debt reduction on which to spend the more than $ 20 billion in cash it generates annually .
as of january , exxon mobil planned to spend up to $ 13.4 billion on capital projects , including developing oil fields and improving its refineries in 2001 , up as much as 20 percent over last year .
exxon mobil 's share could be worth more than $ 2 billion .
` ` investors will be surprised at the scope and size of the asset sales , ' ' said gheit .
size does n't always guarantee success for exxon mobil .
` ` putting mobil together with exxon gave us by far the largest asset base , with more quality projects to do than anyone in our industry , and you can be sure that we 're going to take advantage , ' ' he said .
if the us is a drag on the world oil market , with its enormous imports placing strains on prices , its new - found appetite for liquefied natural gas ( lng ) imports is wholly welcome .
the us has introduced a new dynamic into the market , " says ron billings , head of exxonmobil 's lng business .
but with us natural gas prices double what they were a year ago and looking set to stay high , the industry is scrambling to put the terminals back into operation .
but it is very important to certain areas , and it does not involve building extra pipelines which have become increasingly difficult to site in the us .
the us is also helping something like a spot market to develop in world lng .
a consortium of us oil companies is looking at a second nigerian lng project .
like nigeria , egypt appears to see the us , especially with its current high prices , as a useful supplement to its core european market .
whether the asian market becomes more flexible may depend on the balance in supply and demand in the asian region .
qatar 's rasgas is rapidly expanding its capacity , in conjunction with exxonmobil , in particular to supply india 's petronet ( with which it has the world 's largest lng contract of 7.5 m tonnes a year ) .
on the demand side , india and china are clearly the big potential growth markets in a region where demand has been dominated by japan , south korea and taiwan .
but they may prove difficult and slow to develop , as enron 's persistent payment problems in india have shown .
so , the asian market may develop into the sort of buyers ' market that would allow , for instance , the big japanese utilities to negotiate the shorter and flexible contracts they want .
here are the others points i wanted to make , just briefly : 1 .
they might not want to give mbr to a new enron entity until they see the new rule .
- - the second best way is for me to call dan larcamp or mike coleman , at ferc ; tell them that we 're not in a huge hurry , but we really do n't want a deficiency letter ; read him the language in the draft about how we 'll comply with the new rule , and see if that 's good enough .
- - alternatively , if we really want to try to slide this through without saying anything to ferc in advance , we can file it , and just hope that the language we have about complying with the new rule is good enough .
otherwise , we 're pretty much ready .
i really do think that we could ask for 30 days without raising any eyebrows .
good luck , and i 'll talk to you soon .
in addition we will need to confirm whether sandhills is a subsidiary of
we will work on that further tomorrow .
i wanted to send this draft to you now , however , so that you could review it without constantly being distracted by seeing evsl throughout the document .
thank you for the information on new albany .
thank you for the suggestion about updating the information from the triennial filing .
we will certainly double check to make sure the companies we have listed in the attached draft have not been sold .
you will probably need to run a check on enron at ferc to ensure that between us we have identified any changes to the three year update for epmi which was prepared at the beginning of this year .
if we can do that in the next 45 minutes , we can file today .

hello everyone , just wanted to inform you that i am leaving enrononline operations as of june 1st , 2000 .
i have enjoyed working with you all .
thanks for sending this to me .
since i will be hear through next friday at the latest , i would ask that once this chart has been completed that you contact mark taylor to see who from our group will take this project over while i am out .
, jeff asked me to forward the new report to you .
do we want to see this for each c
i think it would be helpful 2 .
if you move the lower bar to the right of the gray boxes , you will see the new columns which we 've discussed .
i completed the master agreement column from the lotus notes database ; we are currently waiting on credit for the exposure information and their assessment ( e.g. ' credit concern ' , ' good credit ' , etc . ) ; tagg is able to provide term information for each counterparty , but since it is a time - intensive process , ron nolte is looking into adding a button in tagg that will allow this and/or create a special customized ongoing report ; i am in the process of completing the remaining two columns ( i.e. do they sign confirms ?
overall , i think that this new format , including my proposed aging schedule , will be a valuable ' tool ' for all involved in our follow - up work .
so i do n't want the exposure numbers to be limited to any particular type of counterparty .
as we discussed earlier last month , i think it would be good to select a date , let 's say july 5th in this case , and then go forward .
i like your idea of identifying whether the c / p is a ' credit concern ' or a ' good credit ' , perhaps this could be listed in the ' status ' column on the following spreadsheet .
looking over the spreadsheet itself , i would be able to tell you right off which counterparties we consider " credit concerns " , where you would then prioritize on your end .
even though some counterparties may high high exposures , we consider them to be " good credits " ( for example duke ) .
therefore the totals you 'll have for current exposures will not be validated for more than a week , at the max .
i think if i highlight which counterparties we feel you should look into , this would go a lot faster .
wish you could copy dvd movies ?
thanks for your help with this process .
my assistant will be calling you to set up a time next week when ken curry and i can discuss your comments with you and your credit person .
man night i got your email thread right here , dog .
i hope you will have good time and come back with fresh dose of energy .

it occurred to me that we could avoid the problem of real time deals getting unnecessarily confirmed - and unnecessarily confusing counterparties - if we could make " no confirmation " an automatic default for all deals entered under the short term west hourly book .

not sure if there are any risks , but i want to make sure that ron wo n't be harmed by pursuing this opportunity .

one of the questions that the s.e.c. may look into is whether the termination of those transactions should have been treated as a balance sheet item , or whether it should have been taken as a loss that affected reported earnings .
the company appeared to be the dominant force in the business of energy trading , and to be able to produce phenomenal profits .

i also wanted to get your views on enron 's approach to oil trading and whether the vitol group presented an opportunity .
frankly , i think vitol is an excellent acquisition target although the success they 've enjoyed in the last year or two will make it a bit more difficult .

hi martina & trena , i made a few minor changes to the models ...
i became interested in how far dzcv and pllu should be below rpi and whether this model is reflecting any reversion to the rpi level ; i believe that the forecasts are accurately reflecting this .
because the auto - regressive error term is not very important , we can run the models forward with reasonable confidence .
as i mentioned , i do n't think we can really run this model more than 12 months , in fact , i think we should run for 9 - 12 months and blend the next 3 - 4 months out with the long - term model .
hope i can fix the long - term ones now with some new insight !

nymex fixed prices obtained from enron chris , thank you for the conversation the other day .

we came up with a couple things that will improve the process .
call me if you need help .
i will be helping kim , but she is in a better position to execute trades as she is on the desk .

please let me know if you want further follow - up re : your e - mail below .
citizen 's may want to consider pursuing alternative mechanism's?for securing fixed pricing via other accessible markets .

but i think it is important for everyone to understand , i believe getting the pay - out value from the insurance adjustor is a vital element of the calpine- sw deal .
mark t asked if we thought that calpine would buy the unit .

the merger with dynegy , or a similar transaction with any other company , would trigger this provision on closing .

we had a brief but helpful meeting on 7 february , since when i have discussed and signed a contract with annette patrick .
i was hoping to begin work before now , but two lengthy trips abroad have precluded this .
i thought it would be helpful to recap where we now are and what i have in mind .
you summarised the three topics where further work would be helpful to you as 1 .
we could aim to bring this to a wider audience , but there are lots of papers on this topic now , and the situation changes almost daily , so it may be better to incorporate it into a paper on europe .
i hope to talk to kyran on this and related topics , either today or tomorrow , and maybe he has something that he can email me .
perhaps next week we can talk about how to take this work forward , and where to aim at - either a journal like poweruk , or as a direct input into some eu process .

i will e : mail you tomorrow to see if we can schedule a time to meet and hopefully a lunch or dinner , too .
while mr. rosenfield has a mixed record of success with voters , his inflammatory rhetoric in the past has focused public attention on such issues as rising auto - insurance rates and quality of care at health maintenance organizations and helped bring about change .

there appears to be near universal agreement that the ious should enter into long term power purchase agreements and limit exposure to the spot market .
however , some kind expedited review process would allow calpower to be very nimble in the power market and recovery of their revenue requirement would be guaranteed .
calpower 's disadvantage appears to be that it requires yet another new state - chartered non - profit organization .
[ my option would be to declare all customers under 50 kw permanent default customers - green or other marketers could participate through contracts for differences , but physical power would be acquired for all these customers by calpower .
could the role of calpower be better filled by an existing for - profit company ?
the next step would be to get a group of interested parties together to put some meat on these bones and float the idea seriously - perhaps even get some draft legislation on paper to shop around .

despite the general extraterritorial application of us securities laws , i 'd guess an acquisition of a minor swedish - based operation active in the nordic market by a u.k. entity would be too remote to cause attraction over there .

over the last three days , time charter rates for cape size vessel for 12 months starting in january 2001 have dropped by approximately $ 1200 and brokers attribute the rapid decline to the unsustainable spread between the two vessel types .
they told us that they wanted some protection for next year but could not buy puts or sell swaps in the market place for fear of creating a panic selling mode from owners .
our problem is that we do not want to diminish our short position for next year so in offering put options to bocimar , we also want to keep selling the underlying - and that might be challenging as the market is very illiquid and there are not too many bids for next year at good selling numbers .
2003/2004 on time charter for 8 years with ability to extend for three additional years and the ability to buy the vessel after year three in japanese yen .
third parties freight deals sold 3 capes to bhp from brazil to indonesia ( will know if we won the tender tomorrow )

you may want to contact him directly when you have the green light to look outside ene .

if insolvent , the court will request that gmp provide a warranty for the difference between the amount owed and the assets .
the spanish lawyers confirmed our suspicion that the mark to market exposure may be difficult to prove as a debt .
however , as the administrators report is usually ready within 2 - 3months , i suspect that leaving aside any other factors there may be a timing problem here .
but i wd suggest the following : unlikely the old man 's assets will be forthcoming likley the company will go into insolvency likley the creditors will reach a voluntary arrangement therefore unlikely there will be any clawback of earlier payments / strategic storage oil equally , unlikely enron will receive any recognition of its mtm debt chris , let me know if there is anything you wd like to add / clarify .
please respond as soon as possible .
i 'll try contacting you tuesday at 6:00 p.m houston time .
please provide your response regarding tax matters , as soon as possible .
sorry , i did n't provide you my number here in tokyo .

please advise if the equivalent change should be made to paragraph ( b)(iv)(b ) of paragraph 13 of the csa .

since enron corp. will be a credit support provider , does it have a representative director , etc . ?
the clause has been modified to allow different documents to be specified in connection with the enron corp. guarantee .
b&m has stated that in practice they have never been given or asked to review a japanese law opinion in relation to a specific isda schedule entered into by a japanese counterparty and would expect japanese counterparties to be reluctant to provide such opinions .
if that is our theory , there are additional representations ( the eligible swap participant reps ) that we should think about putting back in .
i was not able to find the " eligible swap participant " representation in the enron us isda form ( although there is a reference to this in the opinion ) .
please inform me as to the wording that needs to be added for new york purposes .
we are currently evaluating whether we should revise this section to make reference to the isda 2000 definitions .
any differences in japan from us practice we should be worried about ?
however , there are a number of changes that may be considered including switching the governing law and jurisdiction provisions to japan for ease of enforcement against parties whose principal assets are located in japan .
my only concern here is with the mac clause and it looks like there 's a glitch in the form .
tana is preparing a red - line for me that hopefully will show all of the changes between the us form and the japan form .
i may have a few more comments after i see how that comes out but do n't expect many .
please feel free to call and we can walk through these over the phone if that would be useful .
we should also talk about the most efficient way to prepare these going forward .
but it would free you up to work on other things .
we 're looking forward to having you back .
looking forward to seeing you soon .

just remember there seemed to be a lot of interest in having a credit annex at the meeting on october 13tth .
i think the drafting committee should be responsive to that interest and not wait too long to produce a draft for consideration by the larger group .
it essential to have a credit annex ready for the eei credit workshop in january or february ( date is still to be determined ) .
just a suggestion , it may be a better use of everyone 's time if the credit managers met to discuss the draft of the credit support annex prepared by bill before we get the drafting committee involved .
meeting on december 14 would the drafting commitee and representative credit managers be interested in meeting in new york city on december 14 to discuss credit annex draft .

the difference between a drought and a year flush with water can be as high as 6,000 average megawatts per hour - roughly the capacity of six of the west 's nuclear generating stations .
in a market , new supply will only be built if there is the incentive to do so .

conwell has become a decent tight end from a fantasy perspective this season .
he 's worth staring on a weekly basis if you do n't have a more reliable tight end on your roster .
he has a good knowledge of the rams ' offense and is easily worth starting this week from a fantasy perspective .
considering the huge numbers he puts up on a consistent basis , warner is a a must - start every week .
he 'll post another big game against the new york jets on sunday , so be sure to put him your lineup .

i also indicated that mr. lay would be able to provide the premier with a useful and honest perspective on the events in california and that hopefully , on a going forward basis , the premier would see mr. lay as someone he could phone and talk to about those issues .
i will sketch out a draft of the proposed speaking points early next week .
i will forward each of these per our discussion this morning and will add you to all notifications going forward .
i have also asked aa for their most updated timeline for the year ( they were going to make some changes to the one originally presented at the audit planning meeting a few weeks ago ) - i will pass it along when i get it .
we will schedule an opening meeting with you the week of may 14 , 2001 to discuss audit scope and any concerns or suggestions you may have .
recently , iep forwarded a restructuring / transmission task force solicitatation seeking to raise funds to help fund iep 's intervention in matters such as this .
in the absence of significant funding , iep will be unable to utilize consultants to help in the monitoring and filing of interventions in restructuring / transmission matters .
we will endeavor to continue to keep the members apprised of key issues through the use of in - house staff , but resources will be limited and may make the preparation and filing of interventions difficult .
if you are interested in funding additional support in this effort , please respond asap to the solicitation distributed in august .

the model takes as inputs prices and volatilities and generates a daily spot price grid and respective transition probabilities - a framework for pricing options of multiple kinds .
also , the user may define as many factors as the size of # of points in the fwd curve .
i get the expected spot for the next day by linear interpolation with the prompt fwd .
by ensuring convergence , however , the model creates a spot price vol that converges to the prompt month vol .
regarding the last , i tried as much as possible to make the code clear and lean hoping that you feel confortable with its pieces and usability .
scott needs to work on the capacity sheet so we can tell how much transport ces actually has .
there should be some big changes in ces 's transport numbers for june .
also , if ena elected to release ces capacity to clinton or igs , we need to make sure we record that correctly on the ena sheet .
hal , per your request today , below is an update on the rumoured delay in market opening : last week , legislators grilled the puc and ercot on market readiness for 1/1/02 .
this and the lack of any control measures on the tdsp 's to insure timely switching has fed the fear that the switching delays experienced in the pilot with only 5 % of texas customers will increase exponentially at market opening .
this translates into lack of opportunity to test the billing systems and the edi processes currently in place .
some market participants like new energy are unhappy with changing guards so late in the day and how this will affect the already fragile responsiveness of ercot to market readiness issues .
however , the chairman of the oversight committee steve wollens , stated that if the market is not ready , it may be best to delay the opening date , than to have a blow up .
this is because we understand the impact a delay will have in increasing customer inertia and the potential exposure on our positions and hedges .
we need to make texas work , and work well .
lesson learned last year ... must use the preceding year to a state legislative year to prepare documentation , background and language for any bills expected to be seriously considered in the legislative year .
to avoid last minute hassles , to maximize the potential of this important event and to add real depth and fun to it , a few volunteers are needed to make this happen next january .
i 'll continue to do what i do best , get the notables there and the restaurants to donate food .

we have done much better this year in comparison but for the methanol and formaldehyde the release amounts are reduced due in part to better calculation methods and a different ap-42 for formaldehyde .

i 'm not sure how the fix will work - if there will be a ppa created , or what .

the us - asean business council is developing a briefing paper for the asean trade ministers who will be attending the world trade organization ministerials in seattle , wa later this year .
in addition to providing a larger range of goods and services , rules - based , open markets allow countries to be more competitive in the international arena .
the end result would be a larger international market that will encourage the continued foreign investment and global capital flows .
countries that have adopted measures along the lines of the above have reduced the bottleneck effect that customs can create and have improved the competitive environment for companies within their borders .
e - commerce : in the past few years , electric or " e - commerce " has expanded the depth and breadth of global commerce .
both suppliers and consumers of e - commerce will benefit from an improved legal environment and measures to benchmark policies and best practices in member economies .
to ensure that the industry continues to develop , the wto should give special priority to adopting a permanent moratorium on the imposition of duties on electronic commerce .
with growing demand for energy and calls for clean and efficient use of resources , the wto should look to promote the diversification of energy supply and a market - driven energy infrastructure development .
the us private sector applauds the advances made under the 1997 international technology agreement ( ita ) and looks forward to the beginning of negotiations for the second phase of the agreement .
the continued review and revision of the ita 's product coverage will further expand and distribute the benefits of information technology globally , and is a fundamental necessity for such a fast - paced , dynamic industry .
although the council would encourage discussion of ita - ii during the upcoming round of wto negotiations , we believe that the ita - ii negotiations should remain independent and should be concluded as soon as possible .
thanks for your excellent leadership , generosity and thoughtfulness .
what possible difference can you make ?
and we wish to have your continued leadership .
tomorrow , we will pump out of that tank , and will receive into another tank at least 20 k of sweet .

i would like to keep this confidential especially regarding the new york office .
and i relocated up to connecticut to work with the new power company when i thought that the enron employees would stay enron employees .
after a couple of months i made the move back to enron and went to the new york office and work with the enron metals group here at 53rd street .
and i would really like to come back to houston and was wondering if you could help me .
i would appreciate it very much if you were able to assist / guide me .
in the near future there will be a cost associated with this information and you are currently listed as having a license .

following the call , however , i was told that the noon deadline was firm , but we could make minor text changes on thursday .

hopefully , if anything does arise , problems can be easily and quickly corrected .
please call me at 212 - 713 - 8508 if you have any questions or if i can help you in any way .
thank you , claudia robinson director , employee communications , ubs americas inc.

, you may remember me as the writer who helped on the natural gas chapter for the risk management book .
i kind of doubt that you 'll get any changes since both of the wells have changed in just the last two days , but here 's the scoop .
you may hear from janine with samedan .
i doubt that you 'll get any new changes .
he 's very nice and easy to work with .
that should be all that would need immediate assistance .
nevertheless , it may be simpler to obtain central bank approval with fewer companies .
i would very much like to remove spe from the chain quickly if possible so that if there is a cpmf assessed on the in - kind capital reduction , we do n't have to pay it twice .
i think that would also simplify robert 's legal request .
the adr 's will be legally owned by pep until we make a decision to move them out and go through the process of having a capital reduction to move the shares out of pep .
if ms can do it that s great .
i will prepare the instruction letter , but i am assuming that we want someone at morgan stanley to take actual possession of the certificates .

these were nice too - more contemporary though . . .
we should probably go look at these on sunday .
hi jim , we have n't worked with a term sheet on the equipment sales i 've worked on .
thanks mark - these are mine and i 'll ask louise to be more careful in her addressing .
and he is moving as fast as possible - it may be a good idea to start with a detailed term sheet whilst the fuller document is in drafting ( we will be using external counsel to speed things up ) .
i looked at your list of products ( sent by kevin ) which is a great deal wider than those we quote .
i think the best qay to proceed would be with a manageable list from which we build as soon as both parties are happy with the technology .
i would also suggest we think about setting up a meeting for early next week to go through the draft .
i think we made good progress -- by the end of the day , louise and i were able to resolve most , if not all , major items .
late on friday , kevin sluder from my office forwarded to louise by email a list of the proposed markets on houstonstreet for which we would look to receive prices electronically from enrononline .
louise indicated that you would attempt to have a draft agreement available late in the day on monday or tuesday morning .
so i can make sure i have the appropriate individuals on my end ready to turn it around .
i think it is in everyone 's interest to try to push this forward this week .
please let me know if you need any additional information from houstonstreet .
we shall try to > evaluate the software in houston .
> hope all is well with you .
greg and i are available to meet between 2 and 3:30 today , does that work for you ?
we intend to marry as soon as possible and are currently looking into the possibility of opening our own brothel , with my fiancee utilizing her knowledge of the industry working as the manager .
i am hoping my two sisters would be interested in joining our team .
i love my fiancee and look forward to bringing her into the family , and of course i want to be totally honest with her .
although you 'd have to be a cpa or finance - type to appreciate fully the depth of the apparent deception and subtlety of the accounting methods mentioned in her letter , i 'm struck by ms. watkin 's candor , and how she offers a truthful assessment of the landscape and even a prescription for how enron might claw its way back from this brinksmanship .
can you please let me know if this is something ellis or gary should attend since measurement results and ppas are a hot topic for nng .

and i think what he would like most is a family portrait .
the sitting fee is $ 85 ( if other family units want pictures it would be an additional $ 20 per family plus the cost of film ) .
i thought we could take the portrait after jim & marianna 's second baby is born . . .
if that 's a problem , instead of a christmas present , we could give him the portrait for a combination father 's day / birthday present .

rather than recognize the peril and spend some political capital , davis played for time , hoping that conditions would improve on their own and/or the federal government would come to his rescue with price - cap orders and other actions .
lynch , her critics say , appears to be more interested in protecting the puc 's sorry reputation on utility regulation - its decrees caused many of the problems - than in solving the crisis and may have misled davis , who appointed her .
in my view , it may even make a bankruptcy filing more likely .

tom , i believe that your right up correctly interprets the current model , but as we discussed , i think the more correct methodology is to use the next day 's cash price since the gas daily print is for gas traded the previous day and delivered the same day as the print .
if we do not change the model , i think we need another sentence to clarify that the cash prices a day behind .
if you would like any changes , please mark up / edit
and i 'll make the changes today .

as soon as we have a completed first draft we will want to pull our group back together to review / refine etc .
can you give some thought to whether you yourself will be directly involved or whether you will assign someone from your respective areas .
there are likely others besides our three functional areas that we will need to involve in the review and feedback process , but i 'd like to start with us and then expand as we refine our recommended protocol .
last week we had an extremely productive meeting to begin the development of such a protocol .
we are working to arrange testing access in emergency situations at area hospitals .

filipowski decided his next venture would be in the field of music .
filipowski says his decision to take up the blues was because of the musical genre 's strong association with chicago and under - performing record sales .

omb expressed concern that the data collection would require significant data manipulation in order to respond , and the resulting disaggregation would likely be artificial .
while we would not expect them to withdraw the reporting requirements entirely , it may be that the omb action will affect their final decision .

paulett , can you please add chris stokley and i to the wednesday it meeting with anthony dayao , distribution list .
confidential - do not distribute steve kean would like your comments on this email as soon as possible .
thank you for your email and i apologize for my delay in responding .
for just over a year now , we have been working with multiple areas within ees to develop opportunities on two fronts : 1 ) transferring ees 's weather exposure into the weather derivatives market place and 2 ) developing products for ees to offer to its clients and/or that allow ees to bid more aggressively .
we are very excited about the changes that have taken place at ees and are hopeful that we can now begin a mutually beneficial working relationship .
the harrah 's opportunity originated by ken rubeli appears to have the most immediate potential to provide an ees client with a weather hedge .
our currently long position there has done extremely well and we will be capping out on those positions shortly .
we believe that if ees were to directly approach the weather market place for cdd calls or swaps you could obtain positions that we are unable to i.e. we would like ees to sleeve for the weather desk .
again , we are excited about the new management team and structure at ees and look forward to an opportunity to work with you and your people .
i 've talked with both jeff and mike , and everyone agrees that we need to ensure we can bring weather risk management and products into the ees distribution channel .
i 'd like to know how we can leverage your group , its knowledge and capability to maximize the opportunities we have to move weather products into our sales channels .
please let me know if i can help facilitate taking these discussions / ideas and turning them into executable products .
i 'd appreciate your thoughts on the above items at your earliest convenience .
lunch as you proposed sounds good .
thanks in advance for waiting for me .

although hydro output has kept pace with demand and reservoir water levels continue to rise , the increase is much slower than historical rainy season buildups .
brazil is expected to add 1,200 megawatt ( mw ) of new thermal capacity in 2000 , as well as a further 1,309 mw of nuclear capacity when the angra ii unit enters commercial operation .
this new capacity will help meet the expected increase in demand growth as brazil 's economy strengthens throughout the year but will do little to mitigate power shortages if the current rainfall is insufficient to replenish brazil 's reservoirs .
october and november brought the strongest growth to the paper , beverage , and transportation materials sectors , supported by improved prices in international markets and the start of the summer .
in recent months , however , there has been a slow but steady growth in industrial output , led by a recovery in international markets for export products and an improvement in the economic situation .
this growth is expected to continue in the coming months as brazil 's economy continues to strengthen .
even this limited growth is due entirely to the addition of new billable customers , which has expanded the customer base by 4.6 percent in the 12 months ending in november 1999 .
increasing electricity intensity of new businesses has also played a role , as new businesses have greater electricity needs than their predecessors .
in the interim , thermal generation will remain higher than historical averages and new units , including cuiaba and angra ii , will help increase thermal power contribution to the total generation mix .
this combination of demand growth and uncertain water supply will greatly increase the pressure for new generation capacity .
many risks and uncertainties remain , however , limiting any project 's ability to reach financial closure .
the continued delay in moving projects forward , combined with an additional one to two years of construction once projects are made viable , will further tighten brazil 's supply - demand balance in the coming year , regardless of the availability of water .

in our experience , it is generally helpful to send a letter to a foreign leader before a telephone call or meeting -- it helps frame the meeting and permit the leader to brief himself on the relevant issues , and therefore generally makes the meeting more productive .
that 's why i suggested that neal put together the substance of a letter ( which i would anticipate would strongly set forth the equities in favor of the jose project ) that we could then have in the can for use when time comes to request a phone call / meeting .
i 'll be traveling thursday and friday , but stephen donehoo and gary falle will be available and will know how to reach me if needed .
we should be able to at least talk to him ... letter idea seems a bit tentative at this stage .

i 'm working on the enron case study for harvard b - school and cindy >
derecskey mentioned that you could help me .
640107 title of the call : cera call technical assistance u.s. callers : if you are experiencing difficulties during the call , you may signal for technical assistance by pressing * 0 ( star , zero ) on your telephone keypad international callers : please re - dial and ask the operator for assistance before giving the confirmation code .
i do n't think that entering into this will need lender approval .
miguel , as we analyze what and how to deal with your next cargo requirements , we need the following information : - current levels of inventory at procaribe , broken down between your own and eco 's product - projected as of end of september ( please provide basis ; i.e. , levels of as of the actual date that you provide data plus your projections through end of the month on withdrawals / uses ) - projected sales volumes for the months of october , november , december and january of next year , including ( and this is very critical ! )
i am going to be interested in looking at your assumptions for both progasco ( now tropigas ) and empire volumes , if any .
we need this data as soon as you can so that we can begin to look at cargo options and/or evaluate the decision to borrow from eco .
, i went home last night and continued to study the examples of hedging you were so kind to walk us through and arrived at the following conclusions , which i would like for you to correct me on and/or confirm my thought process . -
first , given the added uncertainty of procaribe 's volumes ( sales ) now that progasco is owned by someone else , unless miguel can guarantee ( through some form of written agreement ) that he will have progasco 's volumes , i think we should be more open to or more inclined to borrow eco 's volumes ( clearly , we would n't do so if the curve looks awful - then it becomes an issue of cash flow vs. product pricing optimization ) .
third , it seems to me that , on the may hedge , ( the second part of the volume ) someone lost big time - i could be wrong , but what i 'm looking at is the fix we got ( suzanne got )
anytime we have that opportunity , we should grab it .
thanks again for all your time and patience .
third , i would make the put / call available anytime ge agreed to it .
indeed i am very happy that you did the release yourself .

this close date is of large significance to gpg as we are going to be asking management to wait an extra week for monthly info that ties out to the financials .
this variance from what we thought was a " common design " is a huge deal , in fact the agreed upon close timing was a major consideration in getting agreement within gpg to go forward as it was an improvement that we could see had value .
it seems like we should already have a plan in place on how we are going to achieve that .

-keep at a reasonable cost -nymex provides seminars which have an audience of 35 to 50 -denise 's experience is that people like topics that are practical adding to their skill base forums - broader topics than seminars with range of experts - can range in size from small groups to very large ballroom settings
max nymex has many contacts and should be able to help on marketing events and perhaps doing some sponsorship .
probably should charge for non members for these events but needs to be reasonable .
small training sessions could be an opportunity .
denise , hope this is a reasonable summary ; please add anything i have left out .
i can certainly send you this file each day - i hope it can be of some help .

for several months we have been working on an idea to exploit the staff and experience we have in special assets to develop a fee - for - service " executive services " business .

as part of some initial feasibility evaluations , we recently have had discussions with bill gartland , a houston entrepreneur , with extensive contacts with national and provincial governmental development agencies in spain .
through gartland 's contacts we have been invited to meet with representatives with the sociedad estatal de participaciones indrustriales ( sepi ) , the spanish state - owned holding company for business development .
in order to take advantage of this opportunity we have accelerated our plans to test the market for the types of services we envisage providing and are scheduled to meet with sepi , info and other contacts in spain the week of june 11th .
however , we have prepared an informal presentation as a briefing prior to next week 's trip .
among the services we offer will be analysis of capital needs and preparation of business and/or project plans for presentation to capital providers .
we will look to acquire significant equity participation that would offer the attractive potential value upside .
as a byproduct benefit through contacts with various businesses , we may identify new synergies and opportunities for other enron businesses .

if the project is not within this cost limit we will need to seek a 7(c ) certificate .
whether we construct the big sandy lateral under the blanket certificate or not , it appears that we would have to file a limited section 4 if we want to implement rates for the lateral that are different from the west of thoreau rates .
as for whether an open season would be required , i assume it would not be if caithness is going to fully subscribe the capacity on the lateral .
however , if other shippers are interested and we want to get the best rate we 'll probably want to have an open season .
at this point i am uncertain whether we even want or need different rates for the big sandy lateral ... ultimately it will depend on the cost of the project and what rates would make it economic for tw to proceed .
i hope this helps ... if there are further questions or if any of this does not sound right to you let me know .
although , the final negotiation are not complete certain options are being evaluated , i need some assistance in interpreting the regulations regarding the authority we should use for approval of this project .
with this in mind , i have the following issues and questions : preliminarily , marketing is thinking that we may want to develop an incremental rate to recover the cost of the project .
would a new incremental rate for this service impact our ability to file for approval under the prior notice provisions ?
can a new incremental rate be established through a limit - section 4 rate filing or is a case - specific certificate required ?
as the facilities will not include any mainline expansion - is an open season required for the project ?
your thoughts and assistance in this matter would be greatly appreciated .
i spoke with richard and we will have to renew .
due to the issues in the west , please advise if we need to amend the expiry date .

going into the meeting we knew that the cftc and the fed were more likely to support the retail swap industry expansion , with the sec and treasury more interested in a regulatory structure that allows their " clients " , the banks and broker / dealers to offer the swaps and protect against systemic risk .
we were able to isolate the sec at the beginning the meeting by noting that we were not planning equity swaps .
we said yes if we are willing to offer sound risk management products to our customers best development : the cftc official pulled us aside after the meeting and said that while treasury may not willing to solely exempting enron , the cftc has the authority and is willing to consider just an exemption .
the cftc is interested in acting quickly to offer regulatory relief and legal certainty for those firms interested in offering these products under the ecp level .

he is very good at " working the floor " , as i call it , of the new york stock exchange .
i think you really made some great points .
high ken , thank you for your response to my email .
i have a few more comments and suggestions !
however , i can not agree with your comments ( or jeff 's ) about short sellers .
enron , under jeff 's leadership , was not healthy and the short sellers ( jackals ) found a wonderful opportunity .
using stock options in lieu of salary is a very powerful incentive but it can also backfire , especially if the proper safe guards are not in place .
a solid domestic asset with a reasonable return is much better than the possibility of much higher returns on assets in unstable , foreign markets .
short sellers will always be around and doing good things for the right reasons truly works ! ! !
in any event , i believe we our making progress in addressing these various problems .
with good success , we will be able to restore most or all of the value we lost this year over the not too distant future .
i appreciate your concerns and your suggestions and i will certainly do everything i can to restore your confidence in enron .
hopefully he will be able to afford the time off to " find himself " .
i sincerely hope you are still capable of doing a good job .

i will attend the meeting if you wish .
unfortunately , the big limitation for us is that we will not be able to net between physical and financial exposures .
this would be a major selling point when we 're trying to establish relationships with new trading partners and trying to build our financially traded products business .
thanks for coordinating an offer for me .
to be honest , i am very flexible myself , it really depends on enron .
if you want me to start right now , then i would expect enron to compensate for my this year 's bonus .
another option is that we can work out an offer right now , and i can start my new job right after i get my bonus from williams , which should be in the very beginning of february .
actually it might be even a little better for me since williams has had very good year this year .
vince , i just want to tell you that i am very interested in your group , and very excited about this opportunity .
please review and if acceptable , we can prepare executables .

having iris visit london hi amitava , we 've been doing some thinking and discussing here regarding the information on our modelling process we 'll provide to darryl duffie .
we think it would be extremely valuable for iris to come out to london for a couple weeks to gain a better understanding of the how the models integrate and are truly employed .
i think this would greatly enhance the " product " we 'll send to duffie as well as giving iris a firm view of enron credit .
in addition , she could also explore some of the data sources such as amadeus and others that might be helpful in private firm modelling .
if we 're extremely efficient / lucky in receiving data from d&b or experian , she might be able to begin analysis on that for the private model efforts .
i would recommend she plan on coming out for 2 weeks starting the week of 30 apr perhaps .
depending on the progress with the private firm data sources , it probably makes sense to send her back to houston to work on calibration sets with a likely return visit to london as required .

a dash - do we want an option vs. a purchase , are we " stepping in " to the people 's wlb structure or are they keeping the financing for " our benefit " , etc ?

our relocation to the new building is fast approaching and there are several important move related items that i would like to stress at this time .
i would appreciate your cooperation with the key move issues that are outlined below :
jeff and i , along with bill donovan , would like to invite you to join us for a tour on this friday morning , june 8th , from 8:30 to 9:30 a.m.
even if you have already had an opportunity to visit the new building , we think this would be a great opportunity for all of us to see the space together and discuss any issues at that time .
if vacant positions exist and they will be filled before the move on august 3rd , they need to be identified on all reports and floor plans with their name , nh ( for new hire ) and an approximate hire date .
any space / move related questions or issues that may arise should be addressed by cathy phillips .
please do not contact susan lopez for any space related issues .
jeff and i have asked cathy and jennifer burns to be responsible for the allocation of space in the new building and they are keeping us well informed as to the progress and any issues as they arise .
jeff and i are very aware that space is very tight in the new building and we will be addressing growth and additional space needs and issues in the near future .
a limited number of turret phones will be available in the new building .
everyone else on the floor will receive a new upgraded version of the lucent phone ( with the existing phone numbers ) .
on the 3rd floor we will have the following public conference space available by making reservations ( specific scheduling details to follow later ) : 1 mega conference room 1 large conference room with videoconference capabilities
1 large conference room - no videoconference 3 team rooms file space on the floor is being upgraded and allocations of file space will be made for each group .
your patience and flexibility with all food related issues will be appreciated .
it is highly probable that food service in the new building will be very difficult at first and as we get closer to the move date , more information will be provided related to food service , deliveries and distribution .
since jeff and i both already keep cathy and jennifer very busy , we would appreciate it if you would send all your comments , questions , or issues to them via e - mail .
there will be a 60 day freeze on any building changes once we move into the new building .
i understand that this is a difficult process and that there are a lot of questions and issues , but jeff and i are convinced that this will be great and everything will work out in time .
thank you for your cooperation and assistance in making this transition to the new building as smooth as possible .
could be fun to see the other island .

i wanted to take this opportunity to update you on a few important planning and communication matters regarding your participation on the north american commission for environmental cooperation 's ( nacec )
electricity advisory board and to provide you with the date for the upcoming meeting .
in august , i had the opportunity to visit the nacec 's montreal headquarters to discuss a number of the key issues to be addressed by the electricity restructuring expert report and to get a better feel for the nature of the guidance and input the advisory board can contribute to this initiative .
more than ever , i am convinced that the outstanding group of individuals serving on the advisory board can play an important role in defining and deepening our understanding of the key trade and environment issues at play on a continental scale .
at this early stage of development of the expert report , i believe it is an ideal time to schedule our first meeting of the advisory board to familiarize ourselves with major issues and provide advice on the scope and content of the report , as well as the broader initiative .
the secretariat has been in contact with you in advance to select a date for our first meeting so that the greatest number of board members can participate .
the meeting coordinator at the nacec , leticia villeneuve , will be in touch to assist you in making your travel arrangements .
the secretariat will soon establish a web site and list serve to facilitate our communications , including the exchange and review of documents .

or , if you have any questions regarding the logistics of the meeting , please contact alicia chica at the secretariat at 514 - 350 - 4330 , or by e - mail at

i look forward to discussing with you soon > my > interest in enron .

we are currently working with the companies to reschedule their presentations as soon as possible .

there should be some interesting opportunities for enron and darby to work together .
2000 - country summaries michelle : i got the answer to the voicemail message i left for you about which lawyer would be the contact for the enron europe countries for the new enron employee stock option plan .
my role in this project is to coordinate the international legal support for the new option plan .
as such , i have contacted lawyers in various international business units to work with local counsel in each of the countries in which enron has employees who will participate in the plan , to ensure that the plan does not run afoul of any legal restrictions .
please forward any changes or comments to me and jana domke ( jana has requested that the review be complete by june 23rd ) .
when that is available , i will send it to you so that you may make any modifications that are necessary to comply with local laws in each of the enron europe countries .
however , on an international basis , there have been numerous regulatory and legislative changes which may impact this program .
because successful plan implementation and rollout is predicated upon solid information , understanding and interpretation , we need your assistance .
please document any specific issues and/or concerns , and where appropriate , provide input on viable options , corrective action , etc ..
also , if you have plans to be in other foreign locations prior to aesop implementation and they need to be included , please advise asap .
please send your responses via e - mail to either dung huynh or myself or by fax to ( 713 ) 646 - 7203 .
our timeline is tight so would appreciate your responses at the latest by june 23rd - earlier if possible .
once we have the input , we 'll roll this information up into a revised summary document , identifying issues that need further assessment / discussion and move forward to coordiinate final resolution with the aesop team members .
you may need to extrapolate your specific locations from one or more of the following attachments .
with respect to the form of proposal letter , i would prefer that you use the form that i have attached .
with respect to the proposed term sheet , the paragraph before the " corrections to published prices " paragraph refers to an annex a which if this deal is confirmed under an isda would not be the correct reference .
hmmmm , i think you 're right .
looks like the more we can get done tonite , the better .
perhaps , if we can wrap the analysis up this evening , we can do some serious divvying up of assigments at the end of the meeting .
i need more information from you about it .

then , you could just go in and open that it in excel or copy and paste it from the csv file into excel , which is easy .

anyone in legal and credit around the world can take a look at this database and determine who we have entered into contract with and what negotiation issues may be at issue .
we need to make a somewhat coordinated effort on the counterparty front .
for online trading , i check the database to see if we have a financial master agreement and what trading restrictions we may or may not have in place .
for both houston and london we use the database to communicate with our clients , whether traders or back office support people .
the database also has some reporting functions that we and london legal have found helpful .
that would be a good time for me to do a full review of this database with you .
we are continuing to expand our coverage and knowledge base of this marketplace , especially in the western hemisphere and would like to meet with you to discuss our observations and learn more about enron 's desires in this arena .
also , we have a meeting planned in d.c. in late june , entitled " lng 's role in north american & caribbean gas supply .
with the u.s. hunger for gas and el paso , aec and other 's announcements of new projects , the meeting should be constructive , especially with doe and ferc involvement .
you may find our conclusions of interest .
they have announced plans for six new terminals to be built in north america : three in the united states and three in mexico .
the conference will then focus on opportunities for lng , including the capacities and timing of current terminals , the prospects for new mainland and offshore terminals , and the opportunity for broader terminal networks in the caribbean , including those facilities that might supply gas or electricity to the united states .
i would appreciate it in the future if you would give me a heads up on what is happening .
it would be helpful if it was ready a couple of hours in advance .
we have recently completed the project and would like to solicit your feedback on the report results .
we have selected your ng price position for april 4 , 2000 ( post - id 753650 ) for the initial analysis .

pls . join a meeting in greg 's office today at 4:15 p.m. today to discuss management 's recommendation to the board of directors on project southwood .
instead of being specific about the route , i will communicate that we are studying alternative routes and it 's premature to communicate which route the pipeline might take .
we will consider community and environmental input to determine the pipeline route .
we have found that in most cases the environmental community is very negative towards a new project if they are called for a quote from the media prior to having a heads - up on the project from the project sponsor .
we are setting a strategy to accomplish this and roll out the project in the best way .
i need to hear back from you by 9 am , thursday , sept. 6 with changes .
after i have your changes , i will forward to stan and corp. pr .
i am setting a meeting for next week to go over the closed transactions and product development ideas .

in allocations being released today , house appropriators are recommending $ 3 billion more than bush wanted for labor - hhs , $ 1.1 billion more for va - hud and $ 1.2 billion more for energy and water .
i think they 're looking for an early opportunity to show their commitment to discipline on spending .
i would n't be at all surprised , if we gave them the opportunity with the supplemental , [ to see a veto].
those of us on the house side feel we have an increased opportunity to get our work done without having to give overwhelming consideration to how it impacts the senate , " blunt said .
rep. michael castle , r - del . , for example , said he thought the senate switch ultimately would allow bush to play to his strength as a master of compromise -- but , in the meantime , expressed confidence in the way house gop leaders were handling the agenda .
at the same time , some observers noted , the bipartisan appeal of the small business community -- combined with president bush 's expected effort later in his term to advance his civil - justice reform agenda -- could help move the ball on some piecemeal reforms .
we are bringing everyone to the table to get this important issue moving forward and resolved , " chao said thursday .
we estimate that approximately two million parcels containing fda - regulated products for personal use enter the u.s. each year through international mail facilities that customs could set aside for fda review for possible violations " of law , fda senior associate commissioner for policy william hubbard told the house energy and commerce oversight and investigations subcommittee .
eliasson , said the steel decision would be " troublesome " to a planned discussion on how the world 's two largest trading partners can avoid trade disputes and advance a new trade round .
asked at a news conference after his speech about reports that bush initiated the steel action to get votes for trade negotiating authority and to help launch a new round of trade talks , lamy said , " if at the end of the day , the european steelworkers have to pay this way , i 'm not sure the new round will be very popular in europe . "
responding to speculation that the united states and the european union would make an announcement in gothenburg about launching a new round , lamy said that would be " premature .
but they have yet to reach a final agreement with majority leader daschle on a new organizing resolution for the senate .
senators said the document would be the basis for some sort of memorandum of understanding or other formal statement about nominees .
that would provide time for the two sides to come to a final agreement that could be vetted by the entire democratic caucus and the gop conference , which meet separately tuesday .
but with the president and congressional democrats poised for a possible battle over his plan to introduce personal stock - market accounts to the system , the job could be even tougher than normal .
adjusting data for persons from new york city with data from persons in miami and seattle has troubling implications , especially when there are important geographic dimensions in the use of census data , " murray said .
facing a statutory deadline to deliver census data , a special bureau panel recommended in early march against releasing sampled data , concluding that it could not endorse sampling as more accurate than traditional data .
democratic supporters of sampling have vigorously argued that with more time , statisticians might be able to validate the sampling data .

mary kay , although we did want to post for 10 years because it helped us in negotiating future contracts , it is no longer necessary to do so for such an extended period .
we can wait until an order on the options is issued but maintaining the 10 year posting has become unmanageable .
the feedback we all received , we that tw wanted to continue posting for the 10 years .
we can relook at that but first , since we did represent in our options filing the 10 info , i 'd like to see how or if the order references that before we change .
steve , maybe , it would be helpful to " round up " all your troups to make sure everyone is on the same page as to the pros and cons of the 10 years .
thanks for the information , i am a little confused as to the timing and the number of years required to be posted now , after the capacity options approval and
after the new cas has been released to you for daily operations .
this is consistent with the historical updating since mid 1998 , and i will continue to do this until the new cas process is tested and released for your group to use(best guess 2 more month - end nom cycles ) .
the new cas process will update the ebb with the same data as the spreadsheets .
we need to determine if we will include all receipt & delivery points , and if we will include a partial group / path list as we currently post .
currently the spreadsheet contains only those points and/or groups that we thought our shippers might be interested in using monthly .
the gas control allocation and facility planning unsubscribed modules are adopting new standard group names , i will let you review what those will be prior to any changes to production .
ideally , i would like no more than 3 ,
drew and steve thought it better to wait until after the options approval from ferc before we made any changes to the ebb .

the project coordinators believe they can reach a solution with accenture in which enron pays no additional fees but the project is completed in a slightly scaled back form .
this allows accenture to have a completed project and no more cash goes out the door .
the effort from the sme 's should be complete by christmas .
please push forward with the review of the knowledge layer .
we pay " 0 " going forward we have already played 300 k in 3q2001 outstanding bill for $ 27,740 will hit enron q1 , 2002 enron and surviving entity will have the right to use it internally
i was thinking to stay away from royalty as we do not know what will be new company position on this matter .
also , i do not think accenture will want to enter into partnership structure with a ghost company unless we get dinergy involved .
the payment could be deferred in to 2q 2002 or 2 .
in the cash flow impact case 2 & 3 already account for additional cut of 100k from existing cost .
the cut in sim exercises need to be confirmed with you .

i ca n't believe you figured it out !
a way for enron alumni to stay in touch .
given the current events of the last several years regarding power generation and delivery across our nation , i have a proposal , i 'm sure will interest you .
it appears that there are vast opportunities available to an aggressive , first mover organization which can pull together the resources , and bring all the players together along with the capital markets to initiate , develop and build additional capacity or to enhance the existing power delivery and transfer .
additional transmission capacity must be built , including additional interconnects between the various grids and/or existed interconnects strengthened .
the ability to transfer power from the east coast to the west coast , as the power demand peak moves across the country from the east , or the ability to transfer power from such area 's as nova scotia which has an abundant supply of inexpensive hydro power would certainly be the ideal situation .
what i propose , is the development of a new enron company , of which its vision would be to identify and develop opportunities to build various transmission assets , and/or additional generation capacity or to strengthen existing assets .
this would be accomplished by bringing various players together under the enron lead , and working with the capital markets to develop a strategy , allowing for the asset to be built .
recently , wapa has issued a solicitation for equity participation , in which private organizations could participate , in the financing , building and ownership with rights to its capacity .
neptune project a private initiative in the new england states being proposed by a group of companies , mostly non - utility for except abb .
this project has recently been approved by ferc and is currently soliciting bids for capacity rights , ownership , etc .
transamerica project another private initiative being proposed by black & vetch along with siemens .
the scope of this project is to build a dc line between the east / west grids , thereby allowing a transfer capacity increase to 6000 mw .
this project has already been presented to the national energy committee put together by president bush as a viable project and potential solution .
this is just the beginning , and given the historical lack of investment in the grid , many more opportunities will had by an aggressive organization with the foresight to put together the team to capture them as they come available .
i envision that this organization would work in conjunction with tranconnect , which portland general is currently a member , in order to expand or compliment their efforts .
as a former enron employee , i am extremely familiar with a number of the organizations , which make up enron , and feel that this would certainly compliment or augment existing operations .
while i 'm not with enron as this time , i certainly am proud of the contributions i made while with such a progressive organization and i am extremely interested in meeting with you at your earliest convenience to discuss this proposal
i looked at the website and it looked great !

re : newsflash jim , i 'm having a very busy day , but sometime in the next week , i 'll call atlantis and ask if they have a non 1 - 800 # so that you can call them directly and give them your credit card info .

sally , i am so excited for you and your promotion .
i have had the privilege to see the impact you have made on this organization , and i am very glad to see you get the rewards you well deserve .
could you please let me know where we stand on these ?

attached is a brief memo i prepared in anticipation of the meeting scheduled for we d . , may 23rd , to discuss setoff issues .
the next system should start cranking up over se colorado today and track towards the great lakes this weekend .
negative departures should become more prominent next week under this polar vortex .
i do n't expect heavy precipitation in the short term from this , but persistent cloudiness and wind will add to the chill .
it is also possible that southern jet stream energy will undercut this polar air spinning up a winter storm in the south that could head up the east coast .
i am very confident in the evolution of this at long last .
it appears to be a fairly long lasting event , the question now is how long and how severe .
one extreme example of how strong this potential may be down the road was a report earlier this week that record high barometric pressure readings were approached in mongolia .
if this trend continues , it could be extremely cold early in 2002 .
best wishes for a happy holiday season .
if you need more pics , please call us again .
because we can not capture the last day of the month right now , as the volume of financial deals grow ( assuming it will ) , it is possible we could be dealing with fairly large pma adjustments .
we may need to start thinking about a way that we could capture these numbers .

others have asked about the plant 's visual impact on the mixed farm and industrial area two miles north of coburg .
john white , who is managing the coburg plant 's application process for the state , said the project has generated more early interest than most similar proposals .
marcus conceded that any power produced by the plant would be sold to utilities elsewhere , but more electricity would help everyone in the west .
he also contended that current design plans would make the plant the cleanest of its kind in the world .
several congressmen have expressed interest in the seat and they can transfer past political cash on hand into a senate contest .
detailing the board 's loadshedding programme , bansal said this year mseb has estimated a shortage of about 1,500 mw for few years which would be met with planned loadshedding in the entire state .

major projects are operating or earmarked for completion within a year in texas , montana , minnesota , kansas and nevada .

wind is a technology that 's now reliable and proven , " says robert morrison , vice president for renewable business development at fpl energy , the florida - based company building the 300-megawatt oregon - washington project .
some of the projects will begin operating late next year .
we are expecting huge growth , especially in the west .
that is good news for david bittersdorf , president of nrg systems inc. , a vermont company that makes wind - measuring devices .
the windmills are " a real curiosity " and may even add to the valley 's tourist trade , he said .
at an earlier meeting convened by ajit kumar some weeks before , the fis ( their team is led by industrial development bank of india ) were asked to see if they could recommend an acceptable way of raising the rs 11 bn needed to complete phase - ii of the stuck project , to clear the way for a sale by enron to third parties , since the union does n't wish to spend any of its own money .
quite a few of them are willing to put in more money to complete phase - ii , but they 'd like the equity holders to reciprocate , too .
this would make it easier for eott to make cash distributions to its unit holders , the company said .

ben roughly speaking if you use absorption chilling , you would save ( at max summer conditions ) maybe 1.2 mw per lm or about 2.5 % on capacity which would be nominally a 2.5 % improvement in heat rate .
for lowell , we possibly could get steam from uae ( i do n't know how the transaction would work ) .
if uae ca n't supply the steam , then we would need small hrsg 's behind each ctg and would most likely also try and steam injection for nox control .
hi vince , having discussed with sharad , we think it would make sense for sharad to go to houston for a few weeks starting at the end of october .
this would overlap with ben 's visit in november and so some alternative arrangement would have to be made for accommodation .

as we approach the transition to a new organizational structure in et&s , let 's rethink the role and competencies of the legal department .
i just want to get access to as much original thinking as possible .
here are just a few great reasons to try all - new aol 7.0 for 1000 hours
" did you know that i could cause you profound , horrifying ,
sara / brent : i did not include you on the initial distribution but thought you might be interested in this since it will have an impact on whether our trading business in brazil can be profitable .
as you are aware , the application of the pis / cofins tax has a significant impact on the ability to profitably conduct a trading and marketing business in brazil .
after talking with local counsel , i have a better understanding of the impact of this latest medida provisoria .
we no longer have the option to pay pis / cofins on a net basis on current transactions based upon a favorable interpretation of medida provisoria 1998 - 1.since we would have had to book a reserve for the tax that we were not paying , this impacts the cash flow and not the earnings that could be booked from a transaction .
however , i think enron needs to focus on getting relief through specific exemptions , much like financial institutions have been able to get .
there is at least one bank that has been given approval to act as power marketer that could be helpful in opening doors for this discussion .
i will keep you posted on tax reform progress as it progresses and will be glad to assist in the development or arguments to support specific regulatory relief for enron 's trading businesses .
thanks again - i'll see you saturday .
hi . let me know if you get this
keegan , please prepare an overnight envelope .
please also update lotus notes to reflect what you find .

i hope to have them complete some time during this next week and will forward them for review .
there may be additional witnesses , depending on information at the prehearing conference .
dale has a great background for many of the ees / ews work that we are trying to do now .
in short , he would be a great catch for us .
perhaps the rest of us could meet him on tuesday .
i think that he could run a urm desk ( east or west ) .
he could run the site profile , asset profile , dsm group .
i would expect that he would expect to come in at a vp level .

transport model for new deals scott , attached below is the transport model i have been using for new deals .
hopefully she wo n't call and give you shit about it .
i know tony will understand if they are already spoken for , but if we have some left that would go unused , we have a volunteer .
i think stock prices may fall further because it 's inevitable that companies will collapse as financial institutions expedite disposal of bad loans .
there may be price hikes , but the impact will be much smaller this time .
we 'll make further adjustments if necessary when we create a new capital investment plan next spring .
electric companies have to develop new revenue sources , such as energy conservation consulting .
while not yet submitting such notifications , at least three foreign firms - enron japan corp. , intergen ( hk ) ltd. and el paso japan co. - have started feasibility studies or negotiations with potential clients .
in spite of the sluggish economy , the utility business appeared to be a promising field because of its huge potential : full - scale deregulation will give access to a market worth around 15 trillion yen ( $ 127 billion ) a year , making japan the world 's second - largest electricity market .
enron , which opened a tokyo office in july last year , is mounting an active challenge to japan 's regulations and traditional business customs .
in may , its local unit released proposals on electricity reform via the internet , which say that if the japanese electricity market had introduced fair competition and reduced electricity costs to the level of the u.s. , large - lot customers could have cut their electricity costs by around 4 trillion yen a year .
another disappointment for the new suppliers was the difficulty of obtaining additional electricity to sell .
but the plan soon ran into difficulties .
for the foreign entrants , the situation is even more severe as they have to build relationships with customers and find suitable sites to build power plants from scratch .
keys curry , head representative at intergen , said : " the environmental impact assessment process is quite long in japan .
he would like to keep david on until may 15 to finish up some things he is working on for ken .
oxy wanted to meet with mike for two reasons : 1 ) make sure enron and oxy had a project team in place asap and the resources are committed to do a world class job on the january 29 submission and subsequent presentations .
we need to be on the same side of the table as oxy .
they expect our competitors to say they 'll finance things on balance sheet and we need initially to say the same thing although later we will open discussions on other ways to finance .
maybe we can do this , maybe we ca n't .
they see this as a year long process with pda 's stretching well into next year , and 2002 when the real money would be spent .
we will also need to prepare a smaller 15 page digest to be used for our official february presentation and a three page walk around summary .
casey thinks the production center has to be in the us .
i have had the greatest success around the world when we do n't try to force immediately on a country a perfect gas or electric market but adapt to " local conditions " and implement the most important first couple of steps with the rest to follow later .
in this respect , our projects can include suggested regulatory concepts that if successful can be used elsewhere in the kingdom .
over and over we came back to the project team which they want on the ground in saudi .
this is a very complicated political and technical effort , .
the leader has to be good at both .
casey was excited that rob would be assigned to the project ( i guess you discussed this with him ) .
they both were quick to say that the working relationship to date has been excellent and that they appreciate the effort we have put into this .
oxy hopes to hedge this risk with downstream investments ( pipelines and plants ) and hopes that if the exploration is successful and reserves are added it will lead to a whole new series of projects .
we all left great friends in good christmas spirit .
it looks like 2001 can be managed with a minimum burn rate with the most intense period of activity being in january .
we need to set up the team for the january effort .
although it may be too soon to answer ( we do n't know yet what is possible but we can shape that outcome ) , what is the end game
this is a perfect laboratory to address all of the market structure issues that will make the kingdom a great place to do business .
i 'm sure you can add more .
rick -it 's up to you if you want to send this around to the saudi team .
david - please send steve & maureen an e - mail with details of how they can install iptv .
michael call chris bowling if you need any assistance with this .
talks on $ 1 billion enron said late last week talks are continuing with potential investors for as much as $ 1 billion .
` ` there is increased concern in the market that there may be more problems that are yet to be disclosed . ' ' on wednesday , enron got a three - week reprieve from lenders on a $ 690 million note due this week , giving the company more time to restructure its finances .
$ 690 million note terms of the $ 690 million note were outlined for the first time in an enron filing with the sec a week ago .
if the company 's cash reserves run too low , enron 's credit rating may be cut below investment grade .

this e - mail is to confirm that you will be providing cxy with a letter that clarifies a few issues that were we were uncomfortable with in the electronic trading agreement for enron online .
we would like clarification that the master agreement already entered into between the parties will govern all aspects of any physical trades made online , including those respecting transaction procedures .
although we understand that the key password holder has the ability to cancel passwords , we would like the ability , over and above that , as a company , to be able to notify you and have you cancel passwords or to terminate the online trading agreement completely .
as we do not yet have the ability to use electronic signatures , notices must be sent as set out in the master agreement or the isda , ( which we appear to be close to signing ) .
thank you again for your assistance with these issues and we look forward to receiving your letter .
please advise if there are any conflicts .

through access to tri - states history data , i can guess what i think the minimum peak for the month will be .
i can look at the current day 's usage and estimate if today 's peak will be higher than the higher of ( 1 ) my estimated peak or ( 2 )
if so , the " probability today is a peak " will be near 100 indicating the operators they should expect a possible power peak sometime today .
it appears possible that this will be a power peak day .
i 'm guessing that my utility could predict around seven peaks requiring turndown in a given month .
i 'm sorry for any confusion .
please let me know if you have any questions , thanks , angela sayegh 713 - 853 - 5021
, the ' probability today is peak ' can possibly be used to reduce > interruptible volumes at nomination time ( if there is a high > probability that today is a peak ) >
because we may hit multiple > new peaks during the month , i estimate we will have around 7 indicated > peaks per month .
ron and i discussed this some more and decided that we should file re condition # 3 which could be read to allow the utilities to use a third party 's credit standing without that parties ' permission .
i hope to work with rod , jerry and the accounting director team ( wiederholt , chandler , and cobb ) to finalize the organization .

land purchase dave : some time ago , i had received approval to purchase the primary block of land for the rio project site from jim .
given the changes , i thought i should run this by you to make sure you would be in agreement .

in addition , i requested that the dispatched person take a laptop along to assist our it group in confirming the register configuration on the rtu so that we can verify that we have correct h2s and h2o level readings at all of our meters .
we have good cellular coverage at this site , and wish to use cellular service to poll this rtu because rtu is in a class 1 , div . 2 area , trying to locate a compliant cellular package or go with cellular package capable of operating under wy winter and summer temperature conditions that can be installed external to the meter building beaver creek
that is more of a challenge than you might imagine in this complicated deregulated world we find ourselves in .
i believe we are making a good start .
it is a very difficult environment for deregulation to work .
i was pleased to see that secretary richardson agrees with me that this market is dysfunctional and i am also somewhat pleased by the initial reports of the action that ferc took today .
as i read the initial reports from the ferc decision today , they are saying the iso and the power exchange are dominated by stake holder members and they think that is ill advised , as do i. there will be new boards established and we will tell you how they are established .
there is a far greater demand for electricity than we can generate in this state .
i want them to know that we are working night and day to find a solution that will ensure that they are not the guinea pigs for this ill - conceived scheme .
i am not pleased that they have not offered any solutions .
it looks like we are going to have to wait until november 9th at the hearing in front of ferc at which their full plan will be unveiled and there will be a chance to comment , critique and modify and then thirty days after that the plan will be adopted in full or in part .
this is a very important meeting in which our administration will be fully represented and i hope to be able to inform the consumers of this state more fully at the conclusion of that meeting if not before .
over the long haul , by that i mean 5 to 10 to 15 years , i believe deregulation can work but only if we have a competitive marketplace and if all parties act responsibly .

bill 's view is that we are 3 to 6 months premature at this point in doing this work for the legal department susan suggested that you might want to call bill to discuss this and talk about how you want to move forward .

we are looking into setting up an electronic approval process for reference credits and counterparties .
the idea is that when traders and originators would need an approval , they would enter the name ( and a few other details ) into an electronic document which upon submission would be automatically despatched to the relevant groups for approval , i.e. , credit and legal .
for a name to be approved , both groups would need to give their approval .
for this process to work efficiently , we need to be sure that each request is seen by at least one relevant person in each group .
could you please be kind and confirm that these names are relevant and add a few more if necessary ( which it is for legal ) .

in the case of looking at ratings this may not be the case so a standard formula can not be applied .
when you are calculating adverse impact on employment actions like hires or terminations it is very straight forward but when looking at it from a rating perspective it can get tricky because you are making comparisions over mutiply categories which mean different things --
i would recommend that you proceed with the chart as i typed it above and not try to build in the adverse impact piece .
the hr person looking at the data in the prc meeting will need to do some quick calculations based on how the distribution is for determining adverse impact .
if you have any questions or if i can help please let me know .

if indeed the bond is needed , could you see if there is a way to transfer the obligations which require the bond to be in place for eemc , from eemc to eesi , in order that we can position ourselves to cancel the bond .

if iso - ne required the amount of the bonds to be increased , in the event that the obligations of eemc were transferred to eesi , travis , please could you advise as to whether the dip financing agreements will permit us to issue new bonds , if the net effect was to reduce the amount of bonds issued as between all enron entities .

based upon getting your concurence and the final review of the model with joe we should be ready to book the transaction early next week .
we have already received a verbal indication from duke that they would have an interest in the facility at $ 9 - $ 11 million .
in addition we believe the most accurate reflection of terminal value in year 5 is closer to our initial purchase price of $ 12 million .
the below valuations , local market grid assessment , and our forward power curve support this conclusion .
on average the last 3 power acquisition transactions in the market were above $ 230 kw and the current market average is $ 213 kw. based upon mmpp 's installed capacity of 70 mw and using the market average of $ 213 kw the plant could be valued as high as $ 14.9 million .

i think the " wes " we were looking for the other day may be wes colwell who i think may be in charge of accounting for ena .
further to our conversation , please see requested sample agreements .
the sales agreement provides that we may terminate the sales agreement immediately without any further obligation if we do not receive an allocation of market support generation .
an " event of default " under the sales agreement ( e.g. filing of bankruptcy ) will automatically establish an " early termination date " and may trigger payment of an " early termination payment " .
however , as a nonlawyer , an interesting question arises in terms of chicken or the egg .
it seems like it would be better to lose msg and terminate the contract without any further financial obligation , than to be in default of the contract and pay an early termination payment .
andre acted for us us the papier mason transaction and i would recommend him to you .
let me know if i can be of any assistance or how things turn out .

i have advised tom barkley to call larry may before the new ostrip was pushed out , making sure it would not affect his book .
in the future , i will make sure this will not happen again .
it is important to note that it is unexcusable to make any changes to the models without consulting the traders first .
this could have meant that the options were being misvalued when trading .
either way , any problems with the models should be communicated with the traders right away .
omar , thanks for the presentation and the e - mail .

at the same time , e power 's office was moved from a building in shinjyuku , tokyo to within enron japan 's office located in the first square building in otemachi , tokyo .
rumors are starting to spread amongst people in the industry that the two companies will merge together in the near future .
it is looking likely that the company 's large - scale gas - fired power plant project in rokkashomura , aomori prefecture , which drew the attention of the energy industry , will be killed off even before a piece of land was obtained for the project .
one could say that e power has done well to have held out this long .
it may have been a mistake for e power , which was established mainly around electricity business specialists from trading companies , such as marubeni , to have joined hands with enron , which is particularly good at using business methods that would not be accepted in japan .
enron corp. i had thought that a major restructuring would take place soon or later , but the extent of which made me realize just how dry an american company could be .
epower 's office was moved immediately to where enron japan 's office is located in the first square building in otemachi , chiyoda - ku , from shinjyuku center building in nishi - shinjyuku ,
you could say that an enron cruise missile has made a direct hit on epower .
z - a man behind the scenes enron may pull out of the japanese market in the near future - this is the opinion that is beginning to spread amongst people related to the energy industry in japan .
amalgamation with epower could also be a possibility .

we would install the side valve and the rest we would let eog furnish [ efm other equipment etc .. ]
eog has recently completed a well in section 253 ( possibly 2000 - 5000 mcfd ) and has plans to drill at least one more well .
i am interested in knowing whether or not there are any other pipelines nearby that they could use to sell their gas .
also , i spoke with perry frazier and i am thinking we would do the tap , install a valve and efm .
happy new year to y' all .

dear vince , we have been working on the curriculum for some of the educational programs to be offered by the energy markets institute that arthur warga and i discussed with you in the summer .
it seeks to provide a broad but rigorous curriculum for future energy industry professionals and managers .
i know you are extremely busy , but it would be very helpful to get your reaction ( even at a broad level ) to these programs and the type of courses that are envisaged .
we view these programs to potentially form the core of the educational activities of the institute , but the next step would be to develop more specialized programs ( of shorter duration ) aimed at professionals already working on challenging problems in the industry .
i will give you more details very shortly .
on another topic , darrell duffie ( with whom i interacted with a lot during our student days at stanford ) will be coming to present a seminar at the bauer college on january 10 .

chris , thanks for explaining your process to me .
but the longhorns have to win out and oklahoma has to lose another conference game for the longhorns to make it to the big 12 championship game .
the next bowl championship series ( bcs ) standings will be a lot different from the first ones that were announced last week and texas will be a lot higher than it was in the last one .
texas could make it to the rose bowl , but it would require some big upsets , like texas a&m or texas tech upsetting oklahoma , and then texas beating nebraska in the big 12 title game .
if you want to keep tabs on the longhorns ' chances to wind up in good shape in one of the big four bcs bowls , the key is that they have to win their final three regular season games .
if oklahoma loses to a&m , tech or osu and the longhorns win out , texas would qualify for the big 12 championship game on dec. 8 .
texas probably will be fourth or fifth in the bcs rankings to be released today and the games mentioned above will be big determining factors in where the horns wind up .
we 've got some issues there we 've got to correct .
this move gives me the chance to be closer to family and an opportunity to further develop my trading skills .
i would like to thank the entire floor for their help in making the real time & also the services desk a success this year .
i am confident that next year will be a great one for each of you
and i wish you luck in your careers at the big e !
hi tana ; i never did receive a copy of the weather derivative confirmation .

given that we ( ene ) are going to undoubtedly be undergoing a whole bunch of change in the next months - it may be worth thinking about how energy ops would look ' post - change ' ...
i guess i 'm thinking along the lines of one central energy ops core - with as many centralized functions as possible - running off as many centralized systems as possible - like a bank model - a central processing facility ( houston ) - with regional / product ' swat teams ' in each / any business units -
really just risk admin folks and deal capture - front end commercial folks may ask this anyway - especially as a cost saving opportunity - it might be good to suggest it / plan for it in advance .....

since the beginning of winter the pacific northwest has received normal precipitation , with greater snowpacks in the northern part of that region than in the southern part .
given current conditions , it is possible that california will end winter at below - average hydroelectric conditions .
because of this high concentration of facilities , above - average precipitation in the pacific northwest can help to offset below - average precipitation in california and other parts of the west , although transfer capabilities limit the amount of energy exported from those regions .
the combination of reduced hydroelectric availability in a normal - weather year in 2000 , a shifting of hydroelectric production back to a second quarter peak , and higher west - wide demand will increase the pull on nonhydroelectric generation resources ( see figure 4 ) .
normal hydroelectric generation this year will likely bring a 250 mmcf per day increase in western gas demand for power generation during the first quarter .
this modest demand increase has helped support prices in the western markets , with regional weather differences contributing to western strength as well .
however , with normal weather in the west , that general weakening in western prices will likely take place toward the end of february and into march .
although february will bring a decline in heating load in both the pacific northwest and california regions , gas will receive some support from decreased hydroelectric generation relative to last year in california .
it seems that we probably do need to assign the agreements .
linda -- please arrange a call - in number for 10:30 am houston time for everyone above for tomorrow .

if we are going to be substantially done by a week from friday , we need to move that portion along faster .

we will get back to enron by the end of november with the definitive quotes obtained so that you can compare them to any alternatives you are arranging .
there may however be some late season percolation in the tropics .
the canadian high is moving toward the coast though and we should soon initiate a broad ( though light ) sw flow of air that will warm the east back to above normal levels .
the most excitement for weather fanatics this week may be late season development in the tropics .
we have a tropical depression in the central atlantic now and satellite pictures suggest another one may be developing over the next 24 hours in the caribbean off the coast of nicaragua .
if it goes this way , we would turn slightly below normal east , a little above in the west and a little of both ( or normal ) in the plains .
can you confirm that i am looking at the right numbers ?
we would also like to trade options for gas and power .
could you run the necessary reports and contact me with our current ability to trade on - line ?
thank you for getting back to me so quickly , i will try to do the > same .
note : this interview with jack crawford of alliance is probably the best information we have gained on the pipeline operational start up and background information .
the last time we did this the forecasts we got suggested that we 'd be running at about 1.325 bcf on the first day .
one of the key questions remaining is whether alliance 's main downstream supply outlet , the 270-mile vector pipeline project , will be ready to go as well on dec. 1 .
the pipeline would transport 700 mmcf / d of gas initially from joliet , il , through indiana and michigan to dawn , on , but would be expanded to 1 bcf / d next november .
it 's been a challenge for them to get going , but it looks like they are all ready to go .
a vector spokesman confirmed that commissioning is going smoothly and operations appear to be on schedule for dec. 1 start - up .
you might want to touch base again next week and see how it looks , but right now it looks like we 're getting things pretty well wrapped up .
the last place where we 've been completing work has been up in the milford and highland townships in oakland county , mi .
once the massive new pipeline is running smoothly , the next steps to be taken include potential connections with several proposed pipelines in and around chicago , including potentially the guardian , horizon and whitecap energy projects .
we 've obviously talked about a potential expansion in the future , but as we found out by talking to people it looks like the supply additions in the western canadian sedimentary basin have not been as brisk as we might have thought , probably because of the downturn in the oil price a couple of years ago .
it 's likely that an expansion would be delayed for a year or two or even three .
the best that i 've been able to ascertain from talking to people is that our supply deliverability really has not increased very much in the last two to three years , and as a consequence at least in the short run the gas on our system will end up coming out of other systems .
john nowlan approved and stinson gibner has the curves available for you .
thanks a lot for your help again .
please let us know if you need any further information .
i think i can probably book you another room at the same rate if you 'd like .
hey monika , do you know where i could find this ?

sally , thanks for the email and update .
i believe that you should interview for summer interns as an extension to your upcoming planned recruiting trip .
i know you were very happy with the summer interns from the energy management program at ou that you got last year
thanks and good luck with the students .
it would seem critical to know what the competition is doing in terms of summer intern interview schedules in order to understand the risk that could be created for enron by not interviewing this fall for these important feeder positions for our analyst and associates programs .
they were pleased to have some help in getting our hands on this critical information .
i strongly believe that we must address this potential risk for enron extremely quickly , as teams will be on campuses across the country to conduct interviews in a matter of days .
please let me know how this can be resolved .
with the help of james scribner and others , we have already compiled a list of students at ut and ou that should be targeted for summer internships .
i will offer as much of my time as is feasible to work with staff members of the program to devise creative ways to turn this around .
as i explained earlier , it will help expedite matters considerably if we get the agenda before the commission on july 31 .
i will follow up with you today after you receive the proposed order , but would strongly recommend agreeing to a proposed order due date of october 10 as that represents the best chance of getting timely approval .
please let me know as soon as possible if enron can live with this .

time period , the amount involved appears to be more like $ 2.61 billion for generators over which the ferc has jurisdictional control .
for all generators , the numbers look more like $ 3.8 billion for the oct.-feb .
this is in line with what we began to warn investors about several weeks ago with respect to this crisis , but it also could represent an excellent buying opportunities in certain names .
alongside a potential resolution of this case through the current settlement negotiations , strong second quarter earnings from these companies could also provide a catalyst .
enron , it would appear from these numbers , could stand to make a windfall from these settlement negotiations .

note there may be a slight shearing in dates , but the concept is more important : market implied cumulative default rates ( % ) : 1 year 5 year 10 year aaa 0.51 5.74 14.54 aa 0.67 6.39 16.61
in looking at the one - year transition rates as a very rough proxy for how many more defaults occur in a recession ( 1991 ) versus average ( 1981 - 1999 ) historical default rates ( % ) : investment grade non - investment grade avg .
on the 10 year historical figures , we need to be careful as the s&p static pool figures show a definite seasoning ( lower defaults in late years probably due to prepayment ) versus our contracts .
i will ask emy to set up a meeting to discuss further .
i would strongly suggest an offsite sooner than later with a handful of the right people so that we can step back and design the right architecture for looking at credit in our deals .
we also need to look at staffing , skills sets , the credit reserve model etc .

isda surveyed total notional outstanding volumes for single name credit default swaps , default swaps on baskets of up to 10 credits , and portfolio transactions of 10 credits and more .
according to thomas montag , chair of isda 's market survey committee , the shifting product use reflected greater uncertainty in the global market environment .
credit default swaps allow buyers to transfer the risk of a default on obligations like bonds or loans , or other types of credit events like a debt restructuring .
germany 's grouse has to do with the mittelstand , the 3 m small and medium - sized companies that are the economy 's backbone .
but few smaller companies are rated in this way .
german bank associations plan to help by pooling credit data for their members .
on november 5th it posted a clutch of new suggestions on its website that included new risk weightings for smaller companies , and proposals that physical collateral , receivables and even leased assets be used to lessen a particular company 's credit charge .
the november 5th pabulum came in response to a " quantitative impact study " ( a live study of how the proposed capital charges would affect a sample of 138 banks in 25 countries ) .
the results should help the basel committee to tweak its formulae to get results .
the timetable may slip , but the plan is to produce a final draft framework early next year , allowing consultation until the end of march , which should result in a firm set of rules by the end of 2002 .
the scope is huge for further descent into mind - boggling detail .
the first report , risk management practices and regulatory capital , compared the approaches in each sector in an effort to " gain a better understanding of current industry practices in all three sectors " .
the joint forum suggested that as supervisors evaluate the extent of cross - sectoral activity , in terms of risk transfer using derivatives , securitisation and other techniques : " it may become important for the individual sectoral frameworks to be updated to better reflect the contemporary risk profiles of the firms subject to those frameworks .
it would not be surprising , for example , for some jurisdictions in the near future to consider greater convergence in the frameworks applied to the different sectors .
the report explained that supervisors should consider the potential for existing capital regulations to provide incentives for capital arbitrage .
as a result , the report said , supervisors should continue to evaluate approaches that could be taken to address crosssectoral investments within the various capital frameworks .
perhaps we should just try this .
, we are leaning more toward the generic language and think that it could expedite the approval process .
i wanted to send this to you quickly before you spent a lot of time on the other one .
later today it is likely i will reconfirm that we are ready to sign the last draft we sent .
attached please find the proposed electronic trading agreement and password application for netco .
i advise that we retain the original description of the website as a platform for the " purchase and sale of products and instruments based on energy products or other commodities ( including derivative products ) " .
i outline below a few of the key changes requiring your consideration :
i added a sentence at the end of section 1 to make clear that in the event the eta conflicted with any other agreement between the parties , including any terms posted on the website , the eta controls .
to the extent that we anticipate such a capability in the future , it may be a good idea to include such a provision .
g. section 6(a ) has been revised to expressly provide that confidential information excludes counterparty identifying information , as well as transactional or biographical information in statistical form .
i have prepared a revised password application , side letter to the eta , and consent and acknowledgment form to be utilized by such counterparties and attach these documents below for your review and reference as well .
however , if you can not reach me , please refer trading or service questions to geir or ryan .
i would be more than happy to be a witness in the case .
i am also sending this notice to our general member representative who may wish to be participants in our pleading .
whereas the general members can not vote on wptf 's major positions , they can participate in the case development , funding , and preparation .

hi sara , i should have the review completed tomorrow .
good thursday morning - comments from the local guys !
with the markets short - term overbought , investors should not be surprised if negative corporate news takes its toll on stocks over the next month .
investors should take advantage of any weakness in their favorite stocks .
tomorrow , we look for another weak employment report for
the rab is expected to release april results next week and we are projecting industry contraction in the 8 - 10 % range .
investors looking for a dramatic pull back will likely be disappointed , and instead we recommend taking advantage of buying opportunities .
* decelerating comps - albeit to be expected - will likely limit valuation upside .
unit opening run - rate will likely continue above the 1,100 full - yr target .
any retreat to $ 16-$18 - a low 30-multiple - would more than discount the issues .
we can not predict when , but we believe that a ruling will come at anytime .
lastly , hhs head thompson , has indicated that the required date for hmos to file m+c changes moves to 9/17 , possibly indicating further changes to come , though we would speculate perhaps " buying time .
the intermediate term outlook is brighter and we believe investors are looking ahead as the lodging stocks have ( and should continue ) to outperform the market as lodging fundamentals improve .

after the motion passed 5 - 0 , the iso and pg&e held focus groups with employers and residents throughout the state to ask customers what they need to more adequately prepare for planned rolling blackouts , and if possible to help prevent them from occurring .
the proactive approach sought by governor davis and by my motion at caiso will include a system by which residents and employers can have their extensive contact information such e - mails , pagers , and cell phones listed in a database .
what is particularly exciting about this proactive approach is that we can better prepare for a blackout with adequate time to power down assembly lines and computers , and power up emergency generators .
by expanding this plan , we can make sure an even larger window of notice is proactively provided to californians .
the plan will be rolled out publicly tomorrow ( friday , june 15 , 2001 ) and incrementally implemented as soon as possible .
we will soon provide further updates on how employers throughout the valley and state on how they can register in the new database for this proactive notification system .
please remain in your cube and someone will come for you shortly .

sara - i am checking internally if we can agree to the below .
i will get back to you in the beginning of next week .
perhaps you could provide us with the regulated affiliate(s ) for a carve out .
before i draft a response , i wanted to clarify that section 3.0 of schedule " c " to the contracting party agreement governing ngx provides for the determination of unsecured credit availability , which is essentially a collateral threshold , for investment grade counterparties or counterparties that have provided an investment grade guarantee , which can be determined in the sole discretion of ngx , but with a maximum for bbb credits of cdn .
accordingly , i will draft a response on this basis , imposing an obligation on ngx to treat us reasonably and equitably , but in the meantime , i believe that we should be taking steps to satisfy ngx 's credit requirements both by providing the margin they require and by having the traders minimize their position to the extent possible .
i will prepare a response and provide a draft for review .
meanwhile we 'll send the margin - our guys should be able to minimize the position .
i would like to remind you that ngx does not provide any unsecured lines to entities who are rated below bbb .
attached are forms you may use to develop your performance improvement plans , including instructions .
i am available to meet with each of you to assist in the preparation and review of these documents .

RE: Suggestions to help short term morale
i like the floor meetings and the idea of getting customers in to know that are business is strong and we are moving on .
i will be back in friday morning for sure .
my thought is to get together an informal team ( does n't even have to be announced or publicized ) to continue to generate ideas that could make a difference to employee morale right now and to make some of these things happen .
sally , some thoughts / ideas that i thought about after your meeting .
lets promote the positive - some very exciting things are happening such as the move to the new building , lets make sure we get the pr out there to talk about the new features , move in plans , etc .
i know security is tight but how about a mini open house .
things like vendors in the lobby to push new technology etc .
work out a decent discount to make it exciting .
even if it costs us a few bucks to make that happen might be worth it .
make a push to host more industry meetings ( gisb is one that i can help with ) .
we can include mini tours of the new building to get the word back on the street about how we might be down
thanks for listening , the sense from my group has been okay .
this is particularly interesting in light of our conversation on the may 7 - 8 mexico city isda conference we are planning .

if there is no master agreement in place between the counterparty and an enron company , the trade should be entered into on behalf of the enron company based in the country where the enron trader is when the trade is concluded and , if there is any hope of further trading with the counterparty , credit and legal should be notified to negotiate a master agreement .
it would be a good idea to consult with legal or tax if this comes up for more specific advice .
if we want the risk to be in an enron company other than the enron counterparty for contractual purposes , an intercompany transaction should be booked ( probably through rmt ) to get the risk in the right place .
steve , risk will give you more exposure in the peer group faster .
re : real options conference in cambridge steve thanks for agreeing to talk .
i think it provides a good general discussion of a very complex piece of legislation .
i assume you will make appropriate distribution on your side .
legislative leaders are drafting a new rescue plan for southern california edison that would put the utility back on its feet financially at the expense of its biggest customers .
although the plan is an alternative to gov. gray davis ' proposed deal to put edison back on its feet financially , it could be used as a model to help restore pacific gas and electric co. to solvency .
noncore would be those using more than 500 kilowatts .
the plan would be phased in through january 2003 to give large energy customers time to prepare for buying power on the open market .
large users who want to remain on the grid could do so .
we 're very concerned that separating the core from the noncore means we will experience extreme rate hikes over the next two years , " said d.j. smith , a lobbyist for the california large energy consumers association .
in the new proposal , the state would have a five - year option to buy the transmission lines for $ 1.2 billion -- the book value of the asset .
in addition , the utility would make $ 1.5 billion available to the state to either purchase other assets -- such as edison 's hydroelectric facilities , for example -- or use it in partnership to build new power plants .

emmitt smith has a chance with wright throwing the ball downfield but with another qb ( likely to struggle )
i 'd think you have to downgrade all the cowboys .
joe thanks to footballguy gary slinkard for pointing me to this one .
if you want to know more about the qb situation than anyone can possibly want to know , here 's a detailed article from mickey spagnola :
as for head coach dave campo , he reaffirmed his belief in wright as the starter , and along with the cowboys trainers , seemed confident wright would be able to start sunday against the arizona cardinals at texas stadium .
they want to put a package together
they certainly seem to want me out there when i 'm ready .

but i 'll be as ready as i can .
and if asked by the coaching staff if he was ready to start , leaf said , " i probably could n't do as many things , but i 'll never say no .
and for a guy who has n't experienced much success in the league , at least not what you 'd have expected from the second pick in the 1998 draft , at least that 's a good sign .
attached are the preliminary reports ready for your review .
all - please review the footnotes under item 3 to make sure the descriptions related to changes in operational capacity are accurately stated .

both of us appreciate it very much .
regardless , if i can help lets discuss in the new year .
the reason i ask is that the leader project at ivey is in need of a new lead sponsor and given the new developments in ontario and alberta with dereg , this may be a great opportunity to get enron 's name out in the business community .
i have already made a $ 250 personal donation to the project and would love to see a greater presence of enron ( houston ) on campus .
but perhaps you can consider the idea and we can discuss its potential in the new year .
thanks in advance , bill heidecker ees , commodity structuring
however , my day 's completely out of control and resolving now may be more than we can manage .
if you folks would like to mess with with it some more , that 's great with me , it 's just that -- and

verifier training after talking with cliff the later part of the week of january 28 will work out the best .
i know that you have reviewed the sbp verifier training cbt module , but we think that a better approach for non - sbp personnel would be a live trainer who can present the responsibilities of the evaluator from the perspective of the oq rule .
the instructor we have in mind has a very good understanding of both the regulatory requirements of oq and the process of skills evaluation .
please reply within the next week so that we can reserve time on the instructor 's schedule .

kyle , i want you to know how much getting your email today meant to me .

hello mike , it has been a while since my last communication with you .
i want you to know that i greatly appreciated you helping me get in touch with ken rice and all of the other folks at ebs last year .
we made great strides and came very close to doing a deal between our organizations .
i have been talking with some of the folks within ebs about the possibility of an origination position with their group .
however , i am of the opinion that ebs is slightly ahead of the market , and therefore the timing may not be right for me to consider an origination position with ebs .
with that being said , i would be very interested in exploring what opportunities might exist within your global markets group from an origination standpoint .
i have solid experience in professional selling , possess excellent communication and entrepreneurial skills .
i would welcome the opportunity to meet with you or the appropriate person within your organization at any time .
thanks again , and i hope to hear from you .
we appreciate your patience and understanding .
to everyone who has already sent it in ? thank you .

the committee has recommended that mseb 's government ownership should be dissolved , however , the control of transmission network should rest with it " .

i thought deregulation might work , " freeman said about the project .
i would n't have done it if i 'd have known what would happen .
i do n't think it 's proper for him to be characterizing everyone else in a negative light .
but after overcoming six months of repeated delays , skipper said early indications suggest the project will be a success and the company is has large expansion plans .
last month the generating barges - positioned next to the country 's biggest power plant at egbin near lagos - began injecting 60 mw into the national grid .
two new projects in works skipper said the company is in advanced negotiations with nepa on two new projects the largest is a 800 mw extension to the ughelli power plant in nigeria 's oil - rich delta state .
negotiators from california and a group of power producers - including representatives from houston - based reliant energy , enron corp. , duke energy north america , dynegy and el paso corp. - agreed to work through the weekend in the hopes of resolving their refund disputes .
davis , however , has instructed his negotiators to make clear he is open to several forms of repayments , including renegotiating some existing contracts or contracting for future power at below - market rates .
davis said friday the state would not be willing to offer to drop ongoing investigations that could result in civil or even criminal penalties as part of those negotiations .
california officials have demanded $ 8.9 billion in refunds for the year ended in may , and some have put overcharges elsewhere across the 10 other states connected to the western power grid at as much as $ 6 billion .
davis seemed to suggest for the first time wednesday that renegotiating terms of those contracts could be a way to deal with california 's refund claim .
if you could send me an email with the correct origination amount i can book it tonight .

i know we are pushing this restructuring as fast as we can ; however , i think we need to determine how to move this faster .
we think most of these amounts are likely to be recoverable , although a significant ( perhaps several year ) delay is possible as these claimants work their way through the bankruptcy process .
by our rough estimation , companies with fairly significant one - time earnings exposure include : nrg , mir , dyn , cpn .
i hope it blesses you as well .
rick , our group has completed our new investment strategy and are preparing to move into the execution phase .
i would appreciate the opportunity to present the strategy to you , dave gorte and randy petersen .
it would take about 1 hour , and i would value your feedback .
the idea is to gain a better understanding of the new environment we will all be living and working in , and to examine the fundamental changes that will impact that environment .
meeting size is usually kept to around 30 people to remain small and informal , encouraging maximum discussion of ideas presented by a speaker or a panel ; we call it strategic conversation .
the assistant secretary would like to hold this highlands to think about the elements of an information strategy , and i have suggested that we look at information and strategy from a business perspective ( transformation , productivity , competitive advantage ) .
we will look at 4 or 5 useful business cases for context .
enron is a remarkable example of transformation in a highly rigid , regulated industry , that has created a new model and new markets .
the defense department is not only creating an operational strategy which has information superiority ( better , faster decision making ) at its core ; the department also has an enormous global business enterprise which can benefit from many of the best practices and ideas from industry enabling it to achieve greater efficiencies and be a better steward of public funds .
i am interested in business cases which ideally describe an enterprise - level information or transformation strategy -- those which see an information strategy as the overarching strategy , or at least as a core component of corporate / operational strategy -- use of information technology , information protection / assurance , crm , and perhaps how to use information and technology to transition or capture or create a new market .
enron is of great interest to us .
what we learn from you may help the department of defense a great deal as it works to build a new strategy .
i hope that you have time on your busy schedule to join us for as much of the highlands forum as you can attend and speak with the group .
i would be happy to tell you more about the forum .
we very much hope that you will be able to participate in highlands forum 16 ; your company has been a key leader in business transformation , and we hope that the public sector can derive new insights to make government services better for all of our citizens .
please let me know if there is anything i can do to assist .

i'd be happy to serve as a reference , for example .

two weeks ago , i wrote " the flood of liquidity is likely to revive the economy next year .
this suggests that the bond rally may be coming to an end .
it could be a long time .
it is hard to see the dow moving much higher soon since it is already discounting a solid rebound in earnings next year with a reasonable valuation of those earnings expectations .
since 1999 , the 52-week consensus expected forward earnings per share has hovered around $ 500 per share and the forward p / e has hovered around 20 .
by the end of next year , however , the dow could retest the record high set in early 2000 of about 11500 .
also , the coming bonus season will probably be the worst since the early 1990s .
i predict that " harry potter ii " will be much less successful .

the problem is when we deregulated we did n't think it would affect us so quickly .

k fyi - may generate some interest from the media ! !
for the energy industry , which depends on the electrical grid as well as internal computer systems , the y2 k bug could lead to unsafe operations at refineries and to shortages in fuel shipments - a daunting possibility for the leading nation in energy consumption at the height of winter .
despite trade group survey results that claim nearly 100 percent of the oil and gas industry will be ready for y2 k - a far more encouraging percentage than the roughly 50 percent reported a year ago - some companies say it would be foolish to expect no surprises .
enron corp. ( ene.n ) , a major u.s. petroleum company and pipeline operator , is among the companies unsure of what the new year will bring .
the planned inventory build could also guard against any potential disruptions at u.s. refineries , which produce the gasoline .
over all , the energy sector appears to be taking the y2 k problem seriously - but that is no guarantee that the new year will be a non - event . "
what the reports are saying is , the trade groups are confident these companies are going to be y2 k ready , and that 's encouraging , " said an official at the federal energy regulatory commission ( ferc ) .

i just spoke with steve doss and explained how to get a power marketer certificate at ferc ( and ewg filing if necessary depending on who west linn 's partner is for plant ownership ) and the 60 day ( generally ) time required ( although i think that ferc would be inclined to wave the 60 days based on the supply shortage in the west ) .
i also explained that epmi is making a filing this week at ferc that would allow epmi to provide some ferc filing services on behalf of industrial customers in order to facilitate their sales to the grid ( when approved , hopefully in about 60 days ) .

if we are still open to changes i would suggest adding a sentence ( in brackets below ) to the paragraph about retail competition that supports a reasonable proposal by the iso market survailence committee .
we all hope that the market will do it anyway but in a disfunctional market certain things need to be mandated . " .....
new competitors need the ample , stable and reliable electricity supplies that a reformed market system will promote .
retail competition can help bring new types of contracts and metering systems , and better awareness of environmental effects as entrants introduce " green " packages , and demand - side innovations .
while i have strongly urged you to resist making large numbers of changes i > think jim 's advice should be included if you have time .
since the super bowl winner wins earlier games to get to the super bowl , they will end up with either 50 % or 55 % , depending on if they have to play in the wildcard round .
new orleans , for example , may not have a chance ( in your mind ) as the super bowl winner , but may get a payoff as a winner of a wildcard game , etc . 1 )
you may start sending them tomorrow , and i will not look at them .
obviously , that information could be useful .
after all choices have been made ( by 4:00 pm friday ) , i will send out a summary to everyone listing how much the pot is , which teams are picked and for how much , how many outstanding shares there are .
you may trade with whomever you wish , how ever you wish .
you may trade those shares and cash for other shares , for cash , etc ; you may structure bilateral options , anything you want .
if the super bowl is won by a nobody ( very unlikely ) , we will have to establish a strategy for that .
i suggest one of 2 options - 1 ) go down the list of super bowl loser , loser of conference championship to super bowl winner , loser of conference championship to super bowl loser , etc , until we find a winner , or donate the money to charity for disaster relief .
that can start tomorrow , but i ca n't see the choices .
i need to circle back to determine where we are relative to getting pricing pulled together for the gas portion .
i 've been in need to put a hard offer in front of this customer for several weeks now .

lee , could you please review the same and see if you agree with this assessment ?
it appears to me that the pigging facilties could qualify as either of the following : special services .
if we did obtain their approval , future o&m cost attributable to the pigging facilities could be shared among the owners .
also , any incremental o&m associated with an expansion can not be passed on to any owners not participating in such expansion .
i think if we went the special services route , we would need to justify the need for these facilities to maintain the integrity and efficiency of the facilities at current levels .
in this event we would need to agree on the inclusion of future o&m attributable to these facilities .
transwestern looks forward to a constructive discussion of the proposal and is confident that the parties will be able to agree on a plan for implementation .

the world technology summit is an historic two - day gathering ( july 1/2 , 2001 ) of several hundred of the world 's key technology players - scientists , technologists , entrepreneurs , industrialists , financiers , journalists , and policy - makers - to explore and catalyse the emerging technologies that will have the greatest impact upon industry and society in the 21st century and to create the relationships which will help those technologies and the companies behind them to succeed .
the summit brings together network members , fellows and other specially invited delegates to think deeply about emerging technologies - how they will likely impact tomorrow on today 's industries and those industries yet to be born .
the last evening of the summit will be capped by a gala ceremony during which we will present the second annual world technology awards , recognising those involved in technology who are taking the actions and making the decisions with the greatest likely long - term impact on business and society .
the new wing is the largest museum facility in the world devoted to new technologies and it 's a wonderfully appropriate site to recognise history in the making .
an interactive exhibit is also being developed which will enable thousands of museum visitors to vote and comment on finalists for the world technology awards during the week leading up to the awards on the evening of july 2nd .
keynote speakers will provide a visionary overview of the interacting roles of technology and business .
session speakers will provide insights into their own particular specialty .
the world technology summit is a gathering where all participants are key players with a crucial role to play in the unfolding drama of technology .
sessions will focus on a range of goals -- providing a good grounding in all six of the major emerging tech .
areas ; on networking opportunities for participants ; and , on developing new ideas for new businesses , new corporate initiatives , new partnerships , and even new industries .
each roundtable group will include an assortment of top - level expertise and will be given a topic / field in which to focus .
p&l. i will describe the complete process in an email in the next few days .
i wanted to revise sa reporting , specifically : - break out an origination line - add copel mtm below the line - start the process of calculating p&l and var by trader ees
i will send the latest one to you shortly and welcome you to comment / critique it .
i plan to work at least partial days from home until the baby arrives , monitoring e - mail and working on a few ongoing projects , and will be reachable at the numbers listed below .
if a candidate like you ca n't win in ca , then a total gop abandonment of the state should be imposed for the next millennium .
nonetheless , in certain cases i thought it made sense to provide you with specific contract language on some of the points we discussed so that you could clearly see what we may be proposing on a particular item .
i know that you expressed some reservations the other evening that this process potentially could be subject to some manipulation .
the draft provides for new york city , although enron is open to other possible locations .
--the revised draft reflects only the $ 127/mwh alternative scenario since you indicated that , preliminarily , you felt that cdwr would not be likely to choose the alternative structure we had discussed .
--we would like to further discuss the effect of an adverse federal regulatory change .
i 'm sure you can appreciate this in light of the current environment , although we would think that freely negotiated bilateral contracts would not be subject to the types of changes being discussed .
enron is not seeking a termination right with lds , but would like to further discuss a termination right without compensation in the event of a major adverse federal development affecting the contract .
however , we think it is appropriate that if that circumstance occurs , that the due date for payments by cdwr should shorten to 7 days and if the bonds are subsequently upgraded that the payment schedule would revert accordingly .
as we discussed , it may very well be the case that at the time any assignment were to be effected that enron may already be at the limit of its overall exposure with those counter parties .
--in light of your response about opinions not being provided by outside counsel , we modified the confirmation to request that the opinions could be from the ag , or if cdwr can not do that , then from the gc of cdwr .
we felt that this would not involve additional work since these presumably will be rendered in connection with the bonds and we provided that they generally would be provided to us after the bonds are issued .
also , it may make sense for our next call to have the respective enron and cdwr commercial folks on the call since it may be the case that many of the final decisions involved may be commercial ones .
thus , it is possible that enron may have further modifications or changes to the documents .
we look forward to working with you to finalize the requisite documents .
as iso indicated to you this is a key regulatory concern of theirs , and i do not want to forward this until i understand enron 's position .
hi tana , i would like to make the death by chocolate if no one has taken it yet .
thank you for your directions , we should have no problems .
we had to make some changes .
i would not want to move forward with either unless you are a " sponsor " and believe such tools would clearly add value immediately .
- i wanted to give you both a brief overview of the reviews this past week of elaw and evelocity .
, the user are the most interested in seeing .
the loading process is fairly easy and could easily be implemented within a firm environment .
some of the functionality that would be the most useful is due to be released in a new version coming out early q1 and by the end of 2001 there is the plan to have at least 10 or so practice areas available .
i think the tool could be useful , especially in relation to the organization of information we obtain from our outside sources .
it may also complement the website / portal concept we are currently looking to make a part of the website / portal development process .
i would be curious to see , however , what other tools are out there doing the same or similar function .
this would require interfacing with ap and the sap system , but it could be done .
reports can be generated in an number of formats to assess financial performance against a budget or overall costs for various matters .
in keeping with the ideas surrounding the technology plan developed for ews , as well as similar ideas presented for the corp. portal / website , it makes sense to look at implementing a matter management system of some sort that goes beyond litigation tracking .
whether or not it is evelocity or another comparable tool would require further research into the available products , but i believe it would be worth while to pursue maybe in a pilot program atmosphere .
if either of you would like further information or have any questions , please let me know .
hello , pat and i were thinking it would be nice to have a wedding shower bbq for alice and jeff .
currently , enrononline can only send one start & end date per deal therefore it will fail in the bridge monitor and will have to be manually entered into sitara & subsequently cleared out of the monitor .
since these transactions could flow next day , it is imperative that these transactions get into sitara as soon as possible .
we do not anticipate a large volume of these transactions but need to be prepared to react quickly when they do .
for the future , we are looking into the cost / benefit of enrononline having the capability of sending multiple dates for these types of products .
if you have any questions , please call me at 3 - 5824
as you know , we have another power plant project -- if i have n't forwarded information to you yet , i will be doing so in the next day or so .
attached to the email i will be sending you is a list of the current information we have here -- lots of documents are here .
please review the data list and forward to me which ones you want copied , and i will coordinate that process .
sara , hope all is well by you .
we agree to discuss further the change in law provision in respect of future transactions .
gerald , can you take a look at mariner 's comments on the confirm and gtc to see if we addressed all of their concerns in the changes that we discussed yesterday ?
i wanted to go ahead and send it to you for your input .
please let me know if you need anything further > on this contract .
: i hope ron singer has given you the needed info .
please feel free to contact me if i can be of any help with regard to your colleague 's inquiry about pursuing doctoral study at uh . < embedded picture ( device independent bitmap )

nokia estimates it is likely to earn 19 european cents a share in the first quarter , in line with estimates it provided in january .
despite the more difficult market conditions , we have been able to show good progress .
we expect to see solid growth for the first quarter as a whole , with better - than - anticipated margins .
it had previously forecast a range of 500 million to 550 million units , saying sales near the bottom end were more likely .
i like your approach and think a call on monday is a great idea .
in the meantime , i 'm gutting the utility proposal on da suspension and trying to turn into a one - pager of an approach we could support to pass around to folks for consideration / review .
i 'll hopefully have that done by mid - morning tomorrow .
here is the number how do folks feel about a call on this subject today .
i 'm having a very difficult time seeing how enron will have any choice other than to vigorously ( and respectfully
i will be considering our options and get back to you with more detail .
your thoughts would be very much appreciated .
penalties and missed opportunities were present for both teams early .
chris simms looked like the man - child everyone was expecting from day 1 .
most impressive was the 3rd and short yardage situations , where texas fans have cringed in the past .

mark : i just wanted to update you on where things stand currently with respect to the domain name transfer agreement that we are negotiating with risk management solutions ,
inc. after visiting with scott about the reps and warranties , he became concerned about the overall scope of the agreement and in particular , what in addition to the url domain name ( weather-desk.com )
we were hoping that you could help us answer this question or at least lead us to the right people that could .
it seems odd that we would be wiling to transfer this name and yet feel that it is important to pursue registering these other names .

rtos have become a priority for ferc , which is looking for ways to make the nation 's patchwork transmission grid more seamless to overcome bottlenecks in moving power between regions .
ferc has praised the pjm system - which serves much of pennsylvania , new jersey and maryland - as a model for nationwide rto building .
pjm could apply its model to a larger rto , harris said , because " it 's hard to find something bigger than what we 're doing .
hopefully that means that there 's less regulation in the future .

the planned 222 mw of new capacity is expected to be phased in commercial operation in the third quarter of 2002 , black hills said .
however , a series of key deals and an improving bottom line in core operations have helped germany 's two blue - chip utility giants , e.on ag ( eon ) and rwe ag ( g.rwe ) , make investors take note - though analysts are divided about which is the best investment .
however , he added germany 's federal cartel office would want the gas market to be deregulated more rigorously before it allows that to happen .
that could be the start of something greater , " said the madrid utility analyst .
construction of a new combined cycle generation facility adjacent to the existing plant will add about 222 mw of capacity to the existing plant site .
the new generation is expected to be fully operational by the third quarter of 2002 .
but she had good news on the sanctions which washington imposed on new delhi after its nuclear tests , saying india had " a role and a responsibility to play in helping secure stable , peaceful conditions in south asia and beyond " .
and we will need to work closely with congress to see how the current situation might be changed .
she said the problems clouding india 's " entire investment climate " could be summed up with a five - letter word , " enron " .
i have to emphasise that it will be difficult for international investors to view india favourably until it is resolved , and in a reasonable manner , " rocca said .

allegheny energy supply 's new holding company also likely will have its headquarters in hagerstown .

shares of allegheny fell $ 2.11 on the new york stock exchange yesterday to close at $ 42.65 .
at the end of the day , these companies will continue to post very strong earnings .
allegheny 's done quite well because everyone 's been expecting this to happen .
in the past couple of years , allegheny has carefully completed each step toward making a spinoff possible .
` ` to leave a legislative solution for another day would be to ensure the problems faced now in california and the west will be replicated across the country , ' ' the new mexico democrat said .

jason , as requested , enron is pleased to submit its proposal to own the oil and gas export pipelines for the murphy medusa project .
enron believes that the pipeline structure is a very attractive opportunity for the venture .
the highly efficient capital model designed for the combined structure is not able to be used on the pipeline structure .
if enron were to be awarded ownership of the pipelines and subsequently awarded ownership of the fps , the venture would be able to take advantage of the combined structure tariffs .
also feel free to contact me with any questions or if i can be of further assistance .
jordan : congratulations on your promotion !

-- we also announced this morning that we are in active discussions with various leading financial institutions about providing financial support to recapitalize and revitalize the company 's wholesale energy trading operations under a new ownership structure .
this will entail a significant reduction in our work force .
in addition , we will submit a severance pay plan to the bankruptcy court for approval .
this approval must be received before we can begin paying severance benefits .
we will be providing more information about this plan as soon as the court has made its determination .

o'connor op - ed piece - california a little opinion piece from our friend at new energy , phil o'connor
we thought that you would find the attached op - ed piece that appeared in the chicago tribune today of interest .
such stories could well create worry that deregulation in illinois and elsewhere in the midwest will lead to san diego - style problems .
while the midwest is realizing the benefit of newly constructed transmission lines that allow access by chicago and other areas to competitive power supplies , many areas in california , remain too dependent on just a few local power plants .
in illinois , utilities and new competitive suppliers , have had more flexibility to offer products that let customers choose between fixed prices that balance out the ups and downs of the market or prices that float with the seasons .
hi sarah - the enron attendees for tomorrow 's meeting are :
attached is the most recent online presentation we have which may be of help / interest and does include latest look and feel .
i can be reached on my cell phone at 503 - 887 - 3449 with any questions .
hi niclas , i am in the middle of preparing some presentations right now ,
it seems others in research have asked about this , so you may already have this at your disposal .
the eia has a good electronic database of plant for and por available for free ( http://www.nerc.com/~esd/ ) .
if you wanted to do it the hard way , you can also ask jaison to access the epa 's cems data he has summarized on a machine there in research .
the wscc 10-year forecast of new plant construction and loads is a good place to start for plant construction information , but suffers from some notorious " self - reporting " error .
other sources that should be more near - term , but more accurate are the cec inventory of plants ( http://www.energy.ca.gov/ ) and the bpa whitebook as far as basic economic data is concerned , you can either rely on the reported utility forecasts for loads , or you can go to fundamental data .
i would like your help with finding some information specific for the west coast .
a new analyst on the west power desk needs information on planned outages and planned new generation .
any help in finding the needed info would be greatly appreciated .

hi terri : i 'll be glad to add you to the email list .
mitch , could this be a re - sell opportunity ?
could be an opportunity for eci to get some quality capacity at a substantial discount .

Beta testers needed for top new technology

plus , as a beta tester , you will receive an additional discount with your shipment that you can apply to the next product you choose to test .
so i talked to a mark who could not give me much of an update .
sounds like you are having a tough week with all the exchange / outlook outages .
hello jeff , per your request , i am attaching a list of questions for you for the friday meeting .
if you would n't mind forwarding him the set of " marketing " questions , i 'd greatly appreciate it .
crs will soon issue a request for proposals for soliciting partners in the renewable energy industry to collaborate with ppreat in response to the cec pier renewable energy program area grant rfp .

i want us to do several analysis that will allow us to better understand what are the financial results of a variety of potential commercial decisions / strategies .
- i assume we are pretty comfortable with the other volumes ; i.e. , in our ability to keep them so i 'm not asking for a sensitivity on those .
please advise when this analysis can be ready and when we can begin to discuss potential commercial alternatives to the pdvsa transaction / giving in to humberto 's demand of mb plus 9.5 .
most likely it will be in late february or early march .
we still plan on having it in tulsa , and i will give more details as the time frame gets closer .
sorry for the change in plans .
once jerry puts together the details we will forward them to you.(hotel , location , and directions ) .

the markup saw a number of amendments from the republican side , but smith ( r - n.h. ) sided with committee democrats at to defeat most , setting the stage for a rough road ahead for the bill before it can move any further in the senate .
while the measure was defeated by voice vote , chairman smith agreed there should be transition funding , but said he could not support the amendment because the mtbe industry would not support an mtbe ban .
the amendment was defeated by voice vote , and it will likely be a difficult fight to gain traction on this issue going forward .
our task in the coming weeks will be to get mtbe producers to agree on the details of a transition package , and agree to back off somewhat on opposing the mtbe ban in exchange for this transition package .
please e - mail or call if you have questions or require additional information .

i expect the bobcats to bounce back with a strong effort here at home , where they are 14 - 7 ats the last 5 years and 8 - 1 straight up recently .
i 'll look for another possible upset here as the irish continue to be overrated .
notre dame has an outstanding defensive front and they should have their way with an inexperienced michigan state offensive line with 4 new starters .
the spartans , meanwhile , qualify in a 95 - 38 - 3 ats road underdog situation that won for me in a best bet on utah at oregon two weeks ago , and they also qualify in a 48 - 16 ats early season road underdog situation that is 17 - 2 ats the last 5 years .
with those angles qualifying , i 'll call for an even closer margin than my ratings project and make the spartans a best bet .
the demon deacons ' veterans have bought into grobe 's demanding work ethic and the results are a 2 - 0 start that includes an impressive road win at east carolina ( a probable bowl team ) in which the deacons out - gained the pirates 451 yards to 294 yards .
wake forest has more talent than is indicated by last year 's 2 - 9 record and it looks like jim grobe has started to get this team to play to their potential .
wake forest , meanwhile , qualifies in a 46 - 14 - 2 ats early season home underdog situation that has been very good to me over the years .
while both of these teams are vastly improved with their new coaches , it appears as if wake forest is more improved and a bit underrated .
with that being the case and with good situations supporting the demon deacons as well , i will call for the upset .
while i respect north carolina 's defense and usually like to take big home underdogs with a strong stop unit , i will side with the seminoles in this game on the basis of a 126 - 58- 1 ats statistical indicator .
it appears as if those pointspread results have given us line value on the side of the bulls in this game and teams that start out the season 0 - 2
buffalo is just 4 - 8 ats on the road since they became a division 1a team 3 years ago , so i will hold off on making a play on them here despite the good value and the good situation .
fresno state has opened the season with 3 straight upset wins and you might think that this would be a letdown spot for them .
however , teams that start the season 3 - 0 straight up are actually pretty good plays as road favorites in game 4 and fresno is as good as they 've shown in beating future bowl teams colorado , oregon state and wisconsin .
tulsa should have some success in the air with talented 3rd year starter josh blankenship throwing to a good corps of receivers .
this looks like another big win for the buffaloes .
smu returns 18 starters from last year 's 3 - 9 team and i expected them to be improved on both sides of the ball .
nc state opened the season with an impressive 35 - 14 win over indiana and their offense looks a bit better than it was a year ago .
smu does qualify in a couple of strong early season indicators , a 31 - 8 ats underdog bounce - back situation and a 46 - 14 - 2 ats home underdog angle , so i will add a couple of points to their total .
and they may be looking ahead to next week 's big game with rival north carolina .
was asking if it is appropriate to use a set of factors corresponding to some commodity for another commodity .
i think using this kind of mappings is ok because we can not trust these correlations based on illiquid price information .
if we believed the matrix with low correlations represents what goes on in the market and we simply can not reconstruct it with our 7 factors - then we might use more factors
so if we believe that the forward prices for this commodity are market prices and statistical analysis on these prices produces the correlations which we trust , then it would be proper to use this correlation matrix in var engine , not the factors .
using factors is simply the way to speed up calculations for highly correlated prices without sacrificing the accuracy .
i agree that we should be using this calculation engine for all commodity vars .
term structure of correlation would be good
i think factor loadings should be calculated , on the same data sets used for inter commodity correlation , for all commodities .
to ensure this moves forward i think a list of the mile stones , responsibilities and time lines needs to be drawn up
we have decided that nbp and cinergy are the best curves available at this time .
hence ( 1 ) we should be using risktrac numbers for var , as it is the " most accurate " , both in terms of ene - wide model usage and in terms of the most recent updated data .
however , as you know , there could be disconnects with enpower , etc .
in any event , it would be ideal and optimal to have all the simulations run out of risktrac for reasons of aggregation and analysis .
thanks , i think we turned a corner yesterday , but i also half expect the desk to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory .
it will tighten , but i think gore may pull it out after all .

we should get a copy of the filing next week and will forward .
the customers had numerous questions for dti about why its upcoming tcra filing will result in such a large rate increase , and advised dti that it needed to provide more information to the customers before they could make a meaningful response to dti 's settlement proposal made on september 15 , 2000 .
the customers said they were still interested in discussing settlement ( in an effort to reduce the impact of the upcoming tcra filing ) , but they wanted more of an explanation from dti of its proposed substantial rate increase .
dti said it had a $ 0.31 per mmbtu basis in this gas and that it was hoping to save it for a future storage project .
at the conclusion of the meeting , the customers said they wanted to ask more questions and would present dti with their questions in the near future .
in the meantime , another meeting to discuss these matters has been tentatively set for october 18 , 2000 at 9:30 a.m. in washington .
the meeting may be cancelled if the parties do not believe it would be useful to help resolve the issues at that time .

here are some thoughts for enron to share with at the analyst meeting .
please let me know if you have any additions , changes , or deletions .
enron believes that there are workable short - term and long - term solutions for california .

we are confident that these funds will be recovered .

although demand for gasoline has been boosted by strong sales of suvs , there is plenty of spare capacity ready for the summer driving season .
oil prices have hovered a little above $ 20.00 recently on concern that the us could disrupt middle east supply by targeting iraq and fears that opec will be unable to successfully pressure russia to extend its production cuts through the 2nd quarter .
phillips says it has improved the success rate of its exploration program by focusing on lower risk prospects in fewer , better areas .
says that oil demand is expected to be weak over the next few months , further pressuring prices particularly in the 2nd quarter .
the opec representative said that if production cuts remain in place , year - end prices should be about $ 18-$20 per barrel .
a small canadian oil company , sheer energy , has received approval from iran to develop masjed - i - suleyman , the first oil field discovered in the middle east back in 1908 .
in a deal made with the national iranian oil company , sheer will be the operator and will have a 49 % interest in the project .
with $ 88 million slated to be spent over 4 years on a reservoir study , vertical and horizontal drilling and new water re - injection facilities , the companies are looking to add 20,000 bpd to production .
bow valley energy is developing the balal field with totalfinaelf and italy 's eni for an estimated $ 300 million .
sheer , which was created specifically to look for iranian oil deals , is not likely to be sanctioned because its share of expenditures would be below the limit over the 4 years of the contract .
under the agreement , sheer will receive payments from future oil sales for 3 years after the project is completed .
the amount will be based on an agreed rate of return at the target production level .
the new company , called cimarex energy , will acquire key production in a $ 220 million transaction .
the acquisition gives key a bigger asset base to explore and produce in the gulf of mexico .
we are very busy with the estate hardware , database and software changes right now .
sometime next week , we will get the netco test database setup and you may create this hierarchy there .
for canada , it would probably be best if ownership resided in houston ( peggy , any feedback would be helpful ) 2 .
recognizing that portfolio hierarchy may need to be augmented pending buyers request , i recommend three portfolio structures .
additionally , we need to correct curve shift reporting in risktrac as well as bench mark positions .
portcalc may need to be modified to handle currency issues and other as well as new curves may need to be created .
when creating new curves , please copy in erms 90 days worth of price history so that we can measure var .
i apologize if this is vague , please feel free to provide feedback .

we provide a lot of equipment for them , heavy construction equipment to build things , " said diana kirby , who handles the pg&e account at hertz 's rohnert park headquarters .
their filing for bankruptcy will have a large impact on us , " she added .
but in a case as sprawling and complicated as pg&e 's reorganization , there is a possibility that the interests of smaller creditors can get lost in the shuffle .
the bankruptcy judge could seek to simplify things by addressing the claims of pg&e 's smaller creditors first , thus reducing the size of the playing field when the big guys begin duking it out .
but the company already is looking ahead to new deals .
we would expect that , after the proceedings are done , they 'll continue to be a good customer .

guys , i would like to add the following commentary to the dash which will better reflect my thinking around this investment .
the current text suggests that there is significant strategic advantage for ena to be a participant in the fund .
i do not think that is the case ; however , i do see some merits in the investment based on the needs of enron 's global finance group .
i would suggest toning down the strategic advantages and add the following : it is unlikely that given the funds target returns that the it will be an effective permanent monetization vehicle for ena 's strategic and merchant investments ; however , enron global finance believes that the investment is important for the following reasons : a ) provides an additional " friend of enron " to facilitate short to medium term balance sheet and regulatory solution to highly structured commodity and capital transactions in the wholesale group ; b ) provides alternative sources of short term capital liquidity and c ) by further developing the relationship with aig provides collateral benefits for enron 's overall global finance capability and business .

president ethan d. hokit commented : ` ` military resale group is pleased and complimented to have become able to represent such a prestigious manufacturer as bayer in our distribution activities .
we have previously forecast that we expect mrg 's sales to increase from $ 4.5 million in 2000 to reach $ 5.5 million over the next year .
bayer 's new presence is expected to make a major contribution to this $ 1 million increase in annual sales that we foresee . ' ' military resale group , inc. was incorporated in 1997 when it acquired a 50-year - old distributor to the military resale market .

second , i have a unique situation .
a good example was a decision to move our primary terapop ( three large servers storing 165 gigabytes each ) from portland to la .
but the decision has huge ramifications on the future la / new york and other bandwidth usage , and that cost money .
now it could be that the la / new york cost is cheaper than the portland / new york cost , the whole point is no one knows .
so ... i really want your views on what we are doing , but thought you needed some flavor and an sense of the urgency .
if you can weigh in , do so quickly .....
i 'll let him share with you if ok

len anthony called and said cp&l of course is interested in enron 's certificate application , does n't plan to oppose it , but is curious because no one has contacted ncng about this site and plant when you 'd think that would be an important part of enron 's bid preparation .
i therefore would like to know how much i should say ..
so we may be able to meet then .

steve : i want to thank you for recently creating the new environment health & safety division .
i think the reorganization and dedicated focus will benefit the entire company .
i thought it was important to show you the inefficiencies of what we were experiencing .
in just a few weeks he has met on an individual and group basis with key people involved in " environmental " issues .
he appears organized , and is doing a great job at sifting through the issues and prioritizing them .
he seems genuinley interested in working with us as a team to develop goals and is enthusiastic and supportive of our ideas and suggestions .
the environment health & safety council also met yesterday and i think finally , this group will do more than just talk .
having said all of that , i also want to share some news with you .
the timing is a little ironic , given the changes you just implemented but i am looking forward to some much - needed commercial experience .
without getting too sentimental , i want you to know that i have really enjoyed working for you and rick .
but it has turned out to be a very positive experience .
everyone has been a pleasure to work with .
thank you for taking a chance on me and making me a part of enron .

if you buy small quantities of notes from a bank , the spread is much wider than 1 per cent .
the idea that profit is a return on capital invested still has some role in new economy valuation , at the level of the overall market .
the trouble with this theory is that it takes too long to produce what the investor is looking for .
the next 200 years may be more stable than the last and microsoft and cisco may prove more enduring than plantations .
in other words , because equities are sure to offer higher returns than bonds , the expected yield on equities should be the same as on bonds .
the value of companies ultimately depends on their capacity to generate cash for shareholders .

on monday evening i went to pick up hard copies of the sessions for which i was interested .
sometime later on wednesday i went to the rack of presentation handouts and there was one available for the above mentioned session .
i assumed that at some point in the near future they might be making copies of the presentations available on the bea web site .
i will try to confirm this tomorrow ( thursday ) .
i will followup with any more details if i remember something else or if there are any further developments .
i will be out of the office on thursday and friday aug 2 & 3 .
you may reach me , if needed , on my cell .
i wish they could get these tie - ins going !
i 'll be out of the office wednesday returning friday late morning .
based on our experience with the tie - ins to date , we are now anticipating 4 days for approval .
if we receive ferc approval tomorrow , we will notify you , but the contract will not become effective until sept 29 .
however , you would have additional capacity available a couple days early at $ .1434 .
hopefully , the above procedure will help you to plan for your nominations by providing more flexability and notice for each additional commissioning .
as the above event is drawing closer , i thought i would write a quick email to finalise a few things with you .
also , if you could send me your conference checklist i would appreciate it , so that i can finalise details with my audio visual company .
david i 've made changes which hopefully deal with your comments - let me know .
mark p. is dedicated to this project and getting up the learning curve by focusing his time on understanding the requirements for a retail affiliate for alberta electricity .
we hope to have a recommendation shortly on an action plan for the regulatory compliance requirements , a recommendation on contracting forms ( separate commercial and residential consumer forms ) and to begin drafting forms .
from asking around , it also seems that any of the firms which have / may have experience in the developing retail market , have acquired that experience for a client that would put them in direct conflict as well ( ex .
, many of whom we have no experience in dealing with in any event .
however , as noted , those with any actual ( or purported ) expertise tend for that reason to be conflicted .
please let me know if you have a problem , as we need to move quickly to get on with the project .
to confirm , you were going to let me know how we should proceed with structuring the affiliate ( liability vs. tax efficiency ) , which may be affected by how and if ees participates .
i had n't included marcie on the call , but would be happy to include her , too .
space is limited , so register as soon as possible .
do n't worry about anything left , if there are any that you could n't read we 'll take care of them .
if you need any help dealing with it to get some of these bugs worked out let me know .
please let me know if you continue to see these deals on your new deal report .
i could n't for the life of me read on that fax , so you may still see deals showing up that do n't necessarily need to be confirmed .
diana - i know we had decided not to confirm deals done with portland general electric , but before i change the following deals to " no confirm " i want to clarify under what conditions we do not confirm with this counterparty .
thank you both for all your help .
i think i have found a super bowl party worthy of our attendance .
tickets are $ 30.00 seeing as this invite came to me by way of a friend of friend , i would appreciate if it was all kept on the hush hush and please do n't pass this along to anyone else .
i will call gary and fran on wednesday hope that they are in the office and can assist me .
louise , i have revised the memo to reflect comments from mark h. and joe d .. going forward we will have a rac representative on the team , however , the specific rac person will change based on the deal .
we need to make turbopark work for the projects and make the projects work for turbopark .
getting everyone on the same side of the table will help .
i do have a general concern about the need for a rigid and corporate based qualification process for contractors .
maybe this is influenced by just visiting dabhol and seeing first hand the problems we have created by using marginally qualified contractors , but to me it would make sense to have a corporate based team including rac for this function .
it is a business that does not neatly fit a yearly reporting concept and requires significant experience to evaluate .
a small team continuously working as a committee on the evaluation of contractors could prevent a lot of tears .

some traders worried that any action against iraq could further anti - american sentiment in the arab world , which could affect oil exports .

in the past ten years , no significant new power generation facilities have been built in california .
dena also asked the governor to use his current authority to allow california utilities to enter into bilateral contracts with energy providers , so they could better manage their exposure to high energy prices .
to help solve the state 's supply shortfall , dena said it remained committed to adding substantial generation in california .
within two months and upon receiving final regulatory approvals , the company will begin construction on 1,000 megawatts at its moss landing facility .
the expansion of the current 1,478-megawatt facility will be in commercial operation by summer 2002 .
and , with an expedited permitting process , dena could deploy its available resources to construct an additional 500 megawatts for commercial operation in 2001 and 1,500 megawatts for 2002 .
to address the concern associated with the high energy prices experienced this year , dena offered to provide up to 2,000 megawatts of electricity to the incumbent utilities at $ 50 per megawatt - hour for a five - year period beginning sept. 1 , 2000 .
this would mitigate the exposure to price spikes , for a reasonable time period during which additional generation resources can be built .
we are confident that our expertise in building and operating power generation facilities can help resolve the supply crisis .

i do not know the salary range for this position - but would expect it to be near entry level .
this may be a bit of a nip to john ( adams ) - but as both bill and i have been talking to him about for a year or so now - enron is a great place to work , training is top shelf -

john is a graduate of the naval academy - former a-6 pilot , a great golfer , and all the rest , and more importantly - has a very good work ethic .
- i want to attend this session but am stuck on a conference call .
i know that would be interested and i am trying to understand more on scope and of course pay level .

, i am looking at this agreement from the credit side .
as i said , this is an interesting and important case study to follow .
another good subject for us to follow up closely is the bill of law 2905 .
however , it may be good for abradee , as the distribution companies will be the only buyers of the cheap , regulated energy after 2003 .
needless to say , they will likely support it .
my concern is that enron will try to look for consensus and we will not be as assertive as we should .
you may want to probe this issue with our top managers in south america , at some points in the future .
we shold then list the changes we would make .
starting with eletrobolt , adding " a " market , and poining out how similar they truly are produces what i think is a great flow and a great argument .

the money sounds fantastic , although i hope that aside from the money you enjoy and are challenged by your new role .
i may not know you inside and out
but i do know that you need to be in an exciting and fast - paced environment to hold your interest and sustain motivation and this sounds like it will provide that for you .
also , the step up position - wise is great
you do know though that fear is a great motivator and often provides us with that extra push to do and try the things we may not have otherwise done .
i guess this means i 'll have a good excuse to visit ny .
well you can ask around you what manager make
so i 'm a little confuse on some things such as when i 'm actually moving to ny , but i m in ny for work next week .

let 's internally add the needed description and move on , i really do n't want to confuse mpc with yet another confirmation .
i said i could not speak for the group , and that one point of meeting is that creditors may have different perspectives that they will want to express directly .
thus , as we said in the letter , i indicated that we would be interested in a commitment to make peace with us before paying everyone else .
i suggested that agreeing to some process for liquidating them ( like the current ferc proceeding ) other than through endless litigation would alleviate some of my concern about ww3 .
i think we can get our stuff laundered at most of the hotels or they can point us the way to a laundromat .

i think " gremlins " got ahold of that last e - mail or else i need a long rest ( this is true ) ! !
in any case , my point was that as long as we are putting together q 's and a 's we might want to include something about aa 's role in all of this , in case it comes up .
if you need some help tracking him down , let me know .

a very good friend of mine ( not me ! ! ) has been offered a position with a fund in the set - up of which these two are involved .
let me know how the position looks tonight .
in paragraph 11 i would suggest that you consider adding the reason given by el paso for this requested change : internal accounting flexibility , i.e. that they may wish to house these swaps in some other el paso entity in the future for bookeeping convenience .
when this change was agreed it was with the understanding that the guaranty would follow the swaps .

nasa - veridian internet - based satellite control project could have implications beyond space industry , and much sooner than 10-year time frame for system 's launch , developers say .
ground industries , including banking , have expressed interest in implementing version of system for their use .
such a system " depends on what they want to do .
he old us " we could roll out a security solution within 3 months .
among those interested in new technology , " satellite vendors are very interested because they look at it as a way to reduce time to build " and validate spacecraft , paulsen said .
system also would allow problems to be detected earlier , giving engineers opportunity to fix them before launch .
employees would need thumbprint to access system , and users could leave desk and others with less access could n't send commands on active user 's log - in .
we could see how deep they got and they did n't get any information from the probe , " light said .
secure missions operations control center ( smocc ) has database built in with information on which individuals have access and extent of access .

this trader would like to trade options on oil or gas if possible .
i do n't have a problems with the position you 've taken -- i just wanted to make sure what it was .
i 'm sure you 've thought of this already , but if the land / farm is n't used in either of the 2 planned wind projects , would you sell the easement to pheasants
first i will give you a history of how
in 1999 in anticipation of a an additional solicitation by nsp , enron expended a great deal of time and money in the acquisition of additional property along the same ridge , further south , that included property owned by carolyn wilson , a widow .
although enron wind was not selected by nsp to build the project , enron made its property available to two other developers for wind development that will include the sale of our enron 1.5 turbine .
the creation of a state wildlife management area on this property could potentially have a negative effect on these transactions and on any future wind project .
we do n't think we are being unreasonable as we have a valid legal contract with mrs. wilson and plans to include her property in a future wind energy project .
i would welcome any input you may have on this matter .
i think this may be the same issue that i had contacted you about last spring .
could you please give me a call with an update and plan of action so that i am in the know and able to respond to rep. holsten ( his office will likely give me a call ) in a manner compatible to whatever your decision is in the matter .
you can reach me at # 612 - 339 - 4599 or send me a return e mail .
and i want to make sure the resident expert agrees that september is late enough to allow us to remove the pad gas if need be .
anyway , sum and substance , i think we 'll be more pleased with the next draft of this document than what was submitted to us recently .
i 'm not sure whether we got consensus there or not -- we 'll have to see the next draft .
the generators were looking at this provision as " throwing a bone " to existing customers who might want to compete with the pipeline for nurf service using capacity ( ex . seasonal ) that may not be fully utilized .
they just want others to have the ability to compete with the pipeline .
overall , as i said , i 'm glad i was there , as well as the other pipeline representatives .
i hope that we were successful in getting the generators back on track here .
i 'll be interested in seeing how much of our discussion today is embodied in the next generator draft .
good luck and call if you have any questions .
today , the generators will be meeting with a small group of pipelines in a drafting session .
let me know if you have any other feedback .
janice / sara , attached please find the fully , negotiated credit terms for an amended master energy purchase and sale agreement between cp and epmi as well as the new credit terms for an isda master swap agreement between cp and ena .
so , allegheny 's attorneys have reviewed the isda terms that we had with merrill in order to " get up to speed " with the isda that allegheny would end up having with ena via assignment or " reproduction of some sort .
i think we will need to " reproduce " the majority of the terms to a new isda w / allegheny .

in the past , snc has announced nice earnings surprises .
to those who closed their eyes and held their breath through earnings , congratulations on a great play !
technical indicators are still positive , but a pullback from its 1-day $ 13 spike after earnings should be expected .
but be ready when the market firms , as fund buyers have fresh cash to buy the big cap tech stocks .
rumors are circulating that msft may still give us our previously predicted split this coming week .
after setting a new 52 week high early on wednesday , it traded down for the rest of wednesday and thursday on what looked like profit taking .
since late november , orcl has been getting a little ahead of its 10 day moving average , then pulling back to it , all in a nice upward trend .
last week this movement was a little exaggerated with ibm announcement , but orcl might be a good candidate for some target shooting around its 10 dma .
the offering will be targeted at manufacturers and will be available sometime during the 1st quarter .
this could be the beginning of the split run .
with the chip industry recovering , it follows that a company in pria 's business will benefit .

he believes mu could trade up into the mid-90s in this market .
after hitting a new high of $ 78.25 on wednesday , mu pulled back with the rest of the market .
if the stock continues to move up on monday , this may be an opportunity to move into options on mu .
it looks like xlnx might fill the gap open it made on the 20th and start a new run .
a good risk reward ratio would be a bounce off the gap on the 20th .
this is a very good sign for the future .
the telecoms are a fast growing industry and this should help xlnx 's future earnings .
for those looking to get in on the split , wait for a pullback after the gap open .
this earnings season has been disastrous for many companies that seemed to have announced good earnings .
lxk has held up slightly better than its industry .
emc reports earnings before the open on 1/26 , and as we indicated last week , we do n't believe there will be a split announcement with earnings .
also , please note that the option root on some emc options has changed .
a close right on the high of the day on friday also shows some internal strength .
they were happy with the " sharp rise " in earnings which were in line with their expectations and the positive future outlook of the company .
in any case , we would like to see the market and sun microsystems turn around before initiating any new plays on the split news .

he wants a chance to back this deal with his sourcing group .
i also asked him if he thought his crack squad could compete with the capabilities that we have developed in the west .
speaking for portland , i would expect that west mm and orig would coordinate .
i suggested that he work it out with you and that i would be looking for direction from you .
i 'm pretty sure that dave will characterize our conversation as though we are in a agreement and that we are ready to move forward .
i would say that we agree that we need to get the best people originating out of these deals .
i am pleased to announce that as a result of that rfp , on friday may 24th , bridgeline executed definitive agreements with duke energy trading and marketing , llc on a three year deal to provide storage and transportation services to be effective june 1 , 2002 .
this contract , providing 135,000 dt / day of pipeline capacity and 2.25 bcf of storage capacity represents a substantial portion of the new storage and related transportation capacity associated with the new ns#1 storage cavern we are completing at napoleonville this month .
we are looking forward to the long - term relationship this contract will establish with such a prominent industry player as duke .
now we must effectively move into the support and delivery of these services where all of bridgeline will have significant impact .
these new agreements will generate higher levels of transactions and service requests from term customers and a need for increased diligence , support and communication .
thank you for all your efforts and commitment which will continue to drive bridgeline 's success .

i understand that the changes that you requested to the swap guaranty are acceptable and that you will receive revised agreements shortly .
hi petr , probably i do n't understand correctly your question .
however you can write any function with several arguments ( input variables ) and after use tapply .

successfully integrating your next generation oss applications tune into this webinar from riversoft / network world and discover how integrating your oss can maximize network availability , increase revenues and improve customer satisfaction .
no doubt customers will want to take advantage of distributed applications .
however , they also want a representative of the service provider to be local to them , so that they can have someone on site if there is a problem or if some planning within the enterprise needs to take into consideration the relationship with the provider .
smaller service providers could potentially offer better products , better features , better support , and better service - level agreements than bigger providers .
i expect , then , that over time we 'll see either more direct entrants into the provider market from ibm and others , or indirect entrants from companies such as ernst & young .

i believe that leslie has been talking to miguel in your group and that possibly there is a meeting set in the near future to discuss development of storage with southwest gas ?
he expressed to me later a strong interest in gas storage development and opined that more gas storage could be very helpful to the region .
it would be helpful for me if i could set up a call between you or whoever would be most knowledgeable on the development of gas storage in your group and the governor 's staffer ( craig marks ) so that he can get a sense of what the real financial / physical / regulatory issues are in such a development .
he has a close relationship with the acc , and could very well be helpful in moving something forward if we had a strong interest in doing something to move gas storage development in arizona .

as things begin to calm down somewhat after events of last week , we wanted to update all employees of certain organizational and personnel changes that have occurred recently .
ultimately , they will be responsible for approving our reorganization plan as to which assets or businesses we sell and which ones we retain .
from an enron perspective , the plans for reorganization have already begun .
we hope to share the wider retention program with you in the very near future .
we anticipate this process to reach closure sometime in january .
as for the remaining businesses of enron , they are all under review as to which ones will be proposed for sale and which ones will be proposed for retention .
we will update you periodically on our process .
among other things , jeff has been working on the business plan for reorganization in chapter 11 and is the primary contact with the newly formed creditor 's committee .
in this role , mark will work with enron 's various business units on all asset disposals , which will be a key element in enron 's reorganization plan and value preservation .
as part of the chapter 11 reorganization , efforts in these businesses will be directed at maximizing value for the creditors as well as determining which businesses or assets will be part of enron 's reorganization plan .
we know as employees the uncertainty surrounding the future of the company is unsettling .
we ask for everyone 's patience and continued support as we move forward through the chapter 11 process .
we are committed to reorganizing into a strong company once again and will need the help of all the employees to achieve that goal .

we 've been trying to get negotiations started since january ; i was hoping you could direct me to the appropriate party to contact at enron so that we can get things moving on this isda ?
if not , could you kindly advise whom i should contact ?
i assume that enron would prefer to send the initial draft documents .
if this is the case , please note that cisa enters into its isda master agreements without benefit of a credit support provider or a credit support annex .
please let me know if you have any questions , or if there is anything we can do to help facilitate the onset of negotiations .

was that it should be enron capital & trade resources international corp. fyi , cargill international , s.a. is located and incorporated in geneva .

dear andy , thanks for the e - mail .
however , the landscape for our business model , industry market penetration , as well as increased competition has eroded the chance for strong revenue success of this company , and i wish to return to enron , but staying within the dynamic , challenging high - tech areas , such as enron global markets .
i have been directly responsible for the creation of the business strategy / plan ( and its changes ) , the pro - forma financial statements and projections that permutate with the strategy , key strategic alliances with best of breed industry participants , venture capital raising process for three series of funding , the investment banking presentations / diligence / ipo work .
i would be open to other suggestions .
i appreciate that you are very busy , but i would very much appreciate hearing back from you if you see a fit between what i can offer and what your group is doing .
however , in respect for your offer of constructive criticism , i would like to once again extend an offer for mediation in an attempt to resolve the ecogas matter , and now these matters .
as i anticipate that you may be on vacation this week , i will wait until next week before proceeding with any new filings .
i 'll probably go for awhile tonight .
we hope to get it out today .
gentlemen - i remembered that i 'm in deposition on tuesday and will have difficulty presenting yao to the legal vp prc .
can i ask for help from one of you ?
on monday , i 'll send over a print - out of yao 's reviews and accomplishments for the first 6 months .
yao has been a big help to me .
that has meant more as i 've been pretty tied up with dabhol .
yao has continued working the deal as best as possible in their absence .
i think that there is a 50 % chance that we can get all or most of the remaining $ 40 million in this deal and yao will be largely responsible for helping to hold it together .
tana , thanks for the redlined version .
a late call ( paris time ) would work for me .
i appreciate your patience with me .

the commercial group would like to have preapproved distribution contract forms available to give to customers so that the customer can submit them to the distribution company when electing a commercial bypass .
we are looking into what we can offer to our customers in the other distribution territories to speed the process of finalising distribution contracts with the ldcs to avoid long delays .
the first meeting will be scheduled early next week .
andrea has faxed or emailed the pertinent information regarding the stamp tax assessment on the technical assistance agreement between tgs and epca to george frumkin , anna sepulveda and michelle blaine who will co - ordinate with tgs and perez companc on the strategy for responding to the assessment .

the focus of the meetings is to determine how a lobbying strategy can be developed and who should be involved in the actual lobbying process .

dow pipeline spur feasibility study -- enron and dow are studying the feasibility of building a pipeline between tgs and two affiliates of dow .
issues include determining whether our ceiasa shareholder and owners agreements preclude enron from building spurs for end users and whether spurs that serve more than one customer can be built under current regulatory guidelines .
i have been asked by to look into how other " marketers " are avoiding the turnover tax and thus be more competitive than we are .
the customer is looking at the relative risks between firm distribution and interruptable distribution but is running up against a deadline for actually requesting a contract template for distribution services .
the contract is slated to begin march 23 , however , the distributor has 30 days to respond for requests for distribution services .

i will pass on your " hello " to the rest of the group .
jeff , thanks for your quick response .
what would you need from us to get the documents prepared for notification .
this should be confirmed ; but since the deal has already flowed , i wanted to check with you before changing anything .
rosh , i 'm sending over some hand - marked comments for your review -- one significant point is that i think we need a definition of " data services " that defines exactly what accenture will do ( reformatting customer - specific transaction data and providing it to qualified customers in an electronic format , but not including mid - or back - office services ( which we may also want to define ) -- some of the provisions ( like the exclusivity ) will be easier to grasp if we have a term describing what accenture will provide .
i will be out starting at 11:00 for the legal department prc ( maybe out for the rest of the day ) , so if we can talk before then to get this wrapped up , that would be great
i think that the more all of us are " conversant " with that structure , it should simplify the legal efforts in closing deals --- especially in q4 .
to that end , please invite those colleagues of yours that could benefit from this presentation and please let my assistant , darlene forsyth at x37254 , know who will be attending so we can reserve the right size conference room and order lunch .
attached is the customizations matrix we have been working on .

we believe that we are in a position to execute this swap ( delta power is at the table ) , but during the past two weeks we have received very strong tolling bids ( merrill lynch , duke , constellation ) for the lv project that imply a $ 20mm value to the project but require a commercial operation date of sep02 .
if we are not able to pull it off , i am confident that the high bids for these machines will still be there .

studness figures existing coal plants have the potential to increase output by 50 million megawatt - hours a year for the next five years , representing about half the expected 2.5%-a - year increase in demand .
substitute enough new plants for old , and u.s. gas consumption , currently 62 billion cubic feet a day , could drop by as much as 1 billion cubic feet a day .

surprisingly , mr. campbell indicated that rate recovery on a going forward basis from the october or november billing periods may be a survivable outcome for pg&e ( this was later downplayed on redirect examination ) .
mr. campbell indicated that pg&e would be satisfied with a 26 % increase in rates .
mr. campbell indicated that customers could expect rate increases totaling up to 40 % over the next two years depending on market conditions .
in any event , given the way president lynch controls the commission , you can expect her view to prevail and rate increases to be more in the range of 18 - 22 % .
it is possible that the commission will allow the recovery of past undercollections , but would net out the undercollections with its generation revenues .
she will likely reject any attempt by the utilities to obtain rate relief on an emergency basis for periods which could be the subject of a full rate hearing .

i know rob has been working on mitigation plans ;
can you give me a call to discuss - we may need documentation to support ; - gas / mid - mkt - jeff ( $ 29m)-
canada is a tricky issue ; however , we should be able to work down the commercial objections and collect on the margin calls to get the number down .
after that , you can schedule it at your convenience for the rest of the 4 weeks .
i am prepared for you ; i bought tide , downey , and bounce , as well as spray starch for all the ironing that needs to be done -- do n't worry
it was highly productive and i would like to thank those who took the time out of their very busy schedules to attend .
in no small way related to the high calibre of the people at the meeting and the skills of the facilitation , we accomplished a great deal .
after looking at the areas , lance thought the easiest team area to have completed first would be the 29th floor area ( it seems to have the right computer / phone jacks )
we have a fourth area available after this for team d : a suite of smaller offices / conference rooms also located on 29 , in 2945 , 2946 , 2947 , and around the corner in 2940 .
we would need other phones installed there as well other the other equipment .
i hope everyone has a merry christmas ! !
i 'm glad you accepted a job at enron .
i know you 'll enjoy it .
i would not recommend ees however .
i think you 're experience would be better at ect ( now ena ) or enron communications .

investors may be shifting their focus away from concerns about anthrax exposure and u.s. military maneuvers in afghanistan to take a closer look at quarterly earnings results , said steven kroll sr . , managing director at monness , crepsi & hardt .
the uncertainty on the global front " looks like it is going to be a long , drawn - out affair , " mr. kroll said .
that resilience might be giving hope to investors this week , he added .
on monday , 3 m guided wall stret 's earnings expectations lower for the upcoming quarter , and a top executive at u.s. steel told analysts that the company 's fourth quarter would be " difficult .
the overall reading from these numbers indicates that manufacturing and services are experiencing a significant slowdown .
on monday , enron said the securities and exchange commission recently requested additional information regarding the limited partnerships .
fastow has been finance chief of enron since 1997 and has been with the firm 11 years , which included extensive work setting up and managing company investments .
enron 's new york stock exchange listed shares fell to a 52-week low on monday following news that the sec requested additional information .

related party transactions " is the heading used by enron in its 1999 and 2000 annual reports to discuss dealings with its limited partnerships , ljm cayman lp and the larger ljm2 co - investment lp , which engaged in complex hedging transactions involving company assets worth hundreds of millions of dollars .
we will cooperate fully with the sec and look forward to the opportunity to put any concern about these transactions to rest .
investors were upset by the news , however , sending shares of enron down dlrs 5.30 to dlrs 20.75 in heavy trading on the new york stock exchange .
enron officials declined to provide details about the transactions or name the limited partnerships , instead referring questions to a section of the annual report on related party transactions .
in the meantime , we will continue to focus on our core businesses and on serving our customers around the world .
enron promised to cooperate fully with the sec request and said in a prepared statement that it " welcomes " the request and looks forward to put " any concern about these transactions to rest .
` ` we need confidence their long - term credit rating wo n't go below investment grade , ' ' said roger hamilton , an analyst at john hancock 's value funds , which own 600,000 enron shares .

lee , i 'll forward you my comments separately .
with respect to rob hemstock 's email of august 31st , and richard sanders and glenn leslie 's comments of this morning , it would appear that the coalition being discussed could have a major benefit to enron and in the normal course of events would be something that enron would participate in .
in the event that enron determines to proceed with the coalition , notwithstanding project stanley , it is my view that a low key role with the right to withdraw from the coalition at any time may be the appropriate way to go given that as project stanley proceeds , we are going to have to work hand in hand with powerex from time to time .
in my view this is something that we should consider further in the next few days
also , ( for kelli , louis , & jonathan ) i have saved an updated version of the model in the dropbox -- i removed the cdo section at mike 's direction .
he 's a nice guy and i believe him to be competent ; however , i think it is a good idea to shop around when you 're doing something routine like a will or an uncontested divorce , so i 'd advise calling several lawyers and see who you like best and who will give you the best deal .

the wisdom , as you well know , helped him to be a great ruler .
god has already given you great wisdom and will continue to bless your life .
lets set up a time to talk , later in the day is best for me .
i encourage other attendees to reply with corrections or additions you think would be helpful to folks who did not attend .
judge smith gave a brief overview of the parties ' opposing positions on the scope of permissible jurisdiction discovery - the defendants limiting that scope to " contacts " and the plaintiffs treating it as tantamount to merits discovery .
i left the courtroom unsure how smith will decide which questions he thinks are within and without the limited personal jurisdiction discovery the cmo allows .
the court finally realized that the defendants were concerned he would be ruling to compel discovery without having considered the various objections , and so made clear he is only going to now evaluate sharp 's questions , give some guidance on which questions seem within the scope of the order , and the defendants can make objections as needed .
i think both sides will wait to see what the judge says about the scope of " limited personal jurisdiction discovery , " then re - evaluate how to proceed with cmo negotiations .
it seems likely to me that we will get to the hearing on the initial motion to dismiss without the discovery having progressed far in substance .
judge smith still seems to think that is the correct logical sequence for the case , but his guidance on the discovery scope will be pivotal .
today 's focus : extra secure by dave kearns novell has announced some new biometric - related partners for its novell modular authentication service , or nmas .

the new partnerships announced are all in the biometric area , covering iris - scans and fingerprints , adding to the already large number of biometric - security vendors supporting nmas .
iridian - iris recognition from iridian technologies is based on the rich detail of the iris of the eye and scales to support millions of users .
precise biometrics - precise biometrics ' precise 100 product family for fingerprint recognition has been on the market since 1999 .
safmodule also provides specialized features such as support for user self- enrollment , a biometric tutorial module and a disconnected login capability for mobile users .

i agree with your following statements : even though this path could be consolidated to be smaller , we have many paths that are a good deal longer .
the size limit of the path needs to be considerably larger , or we need a way to override that for exceptionally long paths .
enron needs to be shown as " bookends " on the transmission we use , or else it could be misconstrued as a purchase or sale .
if that could auto - size vertically
i think instead this should pop up as an addition to the expanded view of the existing deal .
i should be able to cut a path without having to deal with the whole sort menu .
reason text - this is not spelled correctly , and the text box could be much smaller .

while we have certainly been arguing that the market can determine and include the capacity in the energy price ( without the need for a reserves / icap market ) , the new ferc ( massey , breathitt , wood and brownell ) may shed some light on their current thinking in the ne order below issued 8/28/01 .
" in a competitive market , the market itself is expected to provide the signals that new construction is needed .
however , because it can take up to two years to construct new generation ( or longer for certain types of generation ) icap will help to ensure that this new capacity is brought on line when needed in order to avoid critical capacity shortages .
thus , a properly - structured icap requirement serves an important reliability function and provides an incentive for members to build or acquire needed generation in a timely manner .
while the parties .. may disagree over the appropriate methodology to price icap deficiencies , the underlying objective should be clear , i.e. , an icap deficiency charge that will motivate participants to secure sufficient icap , to build new generation , and to offer that generation to others .
among the possible mechanisms , one such mechanism would be the acquisition of reserves on a forward basis ....

phillips production company - hedge phillips production would like to know if it is possible to do a financial hedge for both the nymex settle and basis .
dear vince : i spent a little bit longer putting together my initial thoughts on determining discount rates than i originally anticipated .
i think we need to come up with a way to define the concept of risk capital simultaneously with the appropriate discount rate .
i think it is important to model enron 's opportunity cost of capital and how that changes over time .
the liquidity of a project will affect its value in a very significant way when the opportunity cost of capital changes over time .
there is also likely to be a relation between duration and discount rates that depends on the factors generating enron 's opportunity cost of capital .
i have vague ideas about possible simulations that may help us quantify some of the issues that i have raised .
you might find this somewhat confusing , so i will give you a call later in the week to discuss this .
if you have any questions or will be unable to attend please contact me at 713/345 - 7664 .

similarly , enron japan does currently have weather exposure in japan and , accordingly , can not be said to be hedging weather risk .
we understand that enron japan 's business purposes allow enron japan to engage in weather derivative transaction .
we also note that the financial law board ( paper on derivatives transactions and gambling , issued on november 29 , 1999 ; the financial law board is an unofficial organisation of legal practitioners ) has stated that a company that enters into derivative transactions as a business may be able to argue that it has a legitimate business purpose in entering into the transactions - particularly where the parties to the transaction are sophisticated and the transactions are conducted within reasonable parameters .
based on these factors , we believe that enron japan should be able to give both representations .
we understand that the fsa has provided informal guidance to certain financial institutions to the effect that the provisions allowing financial institutions to enter into financial derivatives are wide enough to also allow financial institutions to enter into weather derivatives .
however , this is a matter that toare would need to confirm with the fsa directly , and we are not able to express a general view - all that is possible is for enron japan to request the representation from toa re .
accordingly , assuming that toare is able to give the representations referred to above , and that these representations are correct , both paragraph ( a ) and paragraph ( b ) appear to apply .
thus , we do not believe that the risk for enron japan in entering into this transactions with toare will be any higher than would have been the case if enron japan had entered into the transaction with a legitimate end user ( for example an air conditioning company ) .
it is conceivable that enron japan may , in the future , enter into transactions with entities that are neither financial institutions nor end users ( for example , other traders like enron itself would fall into this category ) .
in our view , the risk for enron japan in this scenario would increase , but could still be characterised as being " relatively low " .
in this situation , enron japan and the counterparty would give mutual representations to the effect of the representation set out in paragraph ( a ) under question 1 above .
the representations previously proposed were proposed on the basis that the counterparty would be an end user .
if appropriate , we would be happy to provide alternate forms of representations for your reference .
dear jeremy , pls see for your information my email to alan , mark and alan .
i think the answer to question 1 - whether we can give the warranty - has got to be no .
dear alan and mark , i am going to need you to help me make a risk decision .
i welcome input from mark evans but he may be more comfortable leaving this up to alan and mark because alan and mark have been involved in this gambling issue from the beginning .
- given that our legal situation is grey at best , i do not think we should be giving the warranty they have requested .
dear jeremy , i would like to refine the following instructions .
have we already had any written advice from you on whether enron japan can warrant along these lines ?
they are insisting they not give ( ii ) and that we be satisfied with ( iii ) only for the purposes of the gambling law pls confirm in writing whether you think we can still go ahead on this basis .
rodney , from what you told me it sounds like ge is willing to play on the selkirk asset so the sales cycle should be largely completed .
, i 'll give you a response with the hope of seeing more information that would change my mind .
however < if there exenuating circumstances like you feel like we just need to win this at all costs , there are values not being calculated that the client would recognize , there are senior execs at ge plastics behind this looking for a way to close this , or anything else that is convincing your origination team that they have a winner here ....
if it was to put more resource on it to try to make the probability go up , i 'll be glad to help .
i would suggest we just start with trying to get more information from rodney and team regarding why they are convinced this can be contracted for with margin in 2000 .
i would love to participate and do what we can to make this work out , as long as we all agree that there are reasonable approaches to raising the probability of victory .
i 'm looking forward to the visit .
human resources should contact you regarding this trip .
can you review that section to see if you think the language used would tend to make ferc consider regulating enron online ?
we made a similar call to kevin before we starting using enrononline for pipeline capacity , and he seemed to appreciate it .
also , by calling ahead of time , we can answer any questions ferc may have about the filing .
i suggest that we ( enron ) make the filing since we 've had contact with ferc in the past about enrononline .
we 're preparing the epmi filing now , but it should be ready to go tomorrow , so hopefully we can make the call and file tomorrow if this works for everyone else 's schedule .

robert demyanovich , the founder of michigan - based mail2media , a company cynet planned to work with as a vendor , will take on the new posts to help the company reach profitability by early next year .
demyanovich will continue to have an advisory capacity with his prior company , but will move from detroit to houston to take on the cynet position full time .
he has already been instrumental in helping the company shape its revised business plan , along with aggressive cost reduction initiatives as the primary drivers in reaching profitability , " vincent beale said .
with new technology that will be introduced by cynet 's relationship with demyanovich , the software will also let a user design a message and send it via printed media , such as a letter through the mail .
he said he had merely stated that the panel needed to work with a more positive frame of mind .
a new date for the next meeting has not yet been fixed .
india 's federal and state governments , which have guaranteed payments for power by the board and some of the loans to help fund the project , may have to pay dabhol more than 170 billion rupees ( $ 3.6 billion ) if it carries through termination of the 2,184 megawatt power venture .
still , he said godbole 's resignation has helped focus attention on the need for a solution .
the negotiating panel was expected to look at cutting power tariffs as well as third - party sales if the state - run utility could not absorb the power generated by the power project , located at dabhol , on india 's west coast .
this way there is no productive work that can be done .
the project 's 740 mw first phase has begun operation , and the 1,444 mw second phase is expected to be commissioned later this year .
although we are paying the april bill under protest , we hope that dpc will make the required corrections in the may bill which is due on june 5 , " the official said .
meanwhile , according to sources , enron is keen on continuing with the dabhol power project and would like its lenders to continue disbursements , in spite of beginning the termination process .
we look forward to hearing the proposed solutions from the committee , particularly related to creditworthy purchasers for the power .
in addition , we are extremely interested in the centre 's attendance and learning of their expected role .
reuters reported that a senior enron official for the middle east explained at a press conference that enron was not suited to a project that had evolved into a major upstream venture .
totalelffina is reported to be interested in increasing its 24.5 per cent stake in the project although del chairman ahmed ali al sayegh emphasised that del would seek another partner in the project .
enron said it was looking forward to " hearing proposed solutions from the godbole panel particularly related to credit - worthy purchasers for the power " .
an enron spokesman said they were " specially interested in the centre 's presence and learning of their expected role " .
enron india had earlier this year also decided to abandon the proposed joint venture with mseb and global telesystems for a broadband network in maharashtra .
any information that helps investors assess future corporate profits and cash flow " should be encouraged " by regulators and accountants , the task force said in a report issued tuesday .
the group concluded that current disclosure , based on generally accepted accounting principles , or gaap , and quarterly and annual reports required by the sec , produces backward - looking documents showing past transactions that offer little help for understanding where the company is headed in the future .
to spur companies to provide more forward - looking information , the group rejected the idea of more regulation , saying " a far better approach " would be to make it easier and safer for companies to disclose information beyond what appears in standard financial statements .
adopting standard rules for reporting " soft " results would be difficult since much of the missing information is specific to particular industries or companies , the report noted , and rapid changes in economic and business models would quickly make new rules out of date .
we 'll be ready , " said greg onyszchuk , a vice president at williams ' vyvx broadband media unit .
and i do n't think we 'll be the only network ready .
the blockbuster - enron team - up sounded like a great idea when the two companies announced it .
blockbuster said enron 's network could n't deliver the quality needed for transmitting the large video files .
in as blockbuster learned , major motion picture studios want a bigger piece of the vod action , and they 're interested in cutting out middlemen between themselves and viewers at home .
if you want to be in the vod business , you 've got to have a current library of hits , " he said .
studies predict that 10 million homes will have high - speed connections by the end of the year , with 20 million connections expected in the next 18 - 24 months .
but long - haul transmission can develop glitches when there 's heavy traffic on a network - like that created by , say , 20 million vod customers .
vyvx has a 100-terabyte data storage center in tulsa , which onyszchuk said could handle hundreds of movies .
companies like exodus communications ( exds ) and storagenetworks inc. ( stor ) are deploying more data centers with terabyte storage capacity to handle expected demand for services like vod and streaming video .
aggregation at either end of the long - haul transmission networks could help overcome some problems .
the model for vod distribution would be companies like blockbuster , which aggregate distribution rights for movies on video tape .
aggregation at the local level seems ideal for utilities that are getting into the telecom sector .
key players in the california power crisis will address the federal energy regulatory commission staff at a special conference on thursday on the state 's need for future natural gas supplies .
the technical conference will gather information and recommendations about california 's future demand for natural gas , projected interstate pipeline capacity into california , interconnections between interstate and intrastate pipelines , and how the intrastate pipeline capacity is allocated .

shari told me there was nothing more she could do for me if i 'm not seeing the same links that she is ; so at this point i 'm going to call on your expertise one more time , and hope that we can solve this together .
plus it takes a long time to prepare for the case and it looks like your attorney wants to win .
i think i can do this in a gentle and concerning way .
you may recall that lilly entered into a joint venture with chugai in 1999 to gain assistance with developing a number of lilly compounds in japan and as an opportunity to work closely with chugai as a prelude to acquiring a significant interest in the company .
as we discussed in june , it became clear that lilly would not acquire such interest in chugai and we no longer need chugai 's help with clinical development .

new york city area banking stocks have also been showing recent strength after reporting favorable earnings .
prediction that gold could reach $ 300 per ounce .
volume for mortgage and refinancing applications continues to be strong , but what was also helping the sector were new york city area banks .

the pullback appears to be technical in nature , with many having set or trading near 52-week highs during the past few weeks .

from inside ferc ( oct. 8th)--pls let me know if you want more detail or would like to see the ferc filing .
will keep you posted as the project progresses through ferc .
the project would be constructed in two phases .
in the project 's second phase , southern natural would install additional facilities to move 39,177 mcf / day by may 1 , 2004 .
southern natural proposed installing a total of 76,930 horsepower of compression , of which 11,280 hp would replace existing compression facilities that have deteriorated or otherwise become obsolete .
southern natural asked ferc to allow it to roll in the cost of the expansion in its next rate proceeding " based on the considerable benefit to the overall rates of existing customers .
revenues generated from the new contracts are expected to exceed project costs by approximately $ 154 million , thus the expansion would result in " a significant benefit " to current shippers , southern natural said .
the combination of additional compression and new loop pipeline represents a significant enhancement to system reliability for all shippers delivering gas " in southern natural 's market area , the application said .
if this is supported by upper management , i would like to know so i am prepared to deal with the results of the situation .

differences joe - attached is a first shot at getting a handle on all the differences between the proposed and existing margin lines .
the analysis between rates will be very complex and may be something best left to the research group .
what i do plan to do is update historical info .
will we trade in a similar fashion in the future ?
the ideal situation would be for the desks to decide themselves whether a line makes sense for them based on the pricing provided .
as mentioned above , i believe that we should be able to explain why a certain base rate would be attractive but am not sure how to estimate the value of a line to the traders without detailed information .
perhaps the best division of labour would be for the desks to decide what loan would be most valuable based on the desk 's trading patterns while we could focus on getting the line in place as quickly as possible .
i have to find a way to re - post prior day curves out into erms .
all the gdi curve manager files that are pulling the physical index curves should be ready by tonight .
i think we should leave the issue of who and how these curves are set up to the individual desks .
i 'm going to release the files to the desks for them to review and get back to me for changes and revisions .
as for the position manager , there is an issue as to how we would like the new/ changed/ new & changed filter placed onto the position manager .
dave has suggested putting the filter in the menu area where you can manipulate it and then tab between columns .
other than that i do n't know what else is new or important to add .
after i 'm done calcing tonight i 'll go ahead and publish the gdi curves myself .
tomorrow morning i 'll talk with the risk leads and ask them if they can review and load the curves from here on out .
i 'll also start modifying the curve files to include an additional month so we wo nt run into that problem again .
that should be done for eod tomorrow .

how could a company have a price - to - earnings
if it 's growing rapidly and is expected to earn $ 3.50 next year , the projected p / e for that year is 22 ( 77 divided by 3.50 is 22 ) .
since stock prices are tied to how much a company can earn , higher interest rates theoretically cause stock prices to fall .

given that we have worked closely with minton 's , underwriters ' representatives , i would assume that we are under no time pressure to give underwriters a total quantum before the joint survey takes place ; in fact , it looks like the final determination of ect 's total quantum of damages may be impacted by the results of the joint survey ( although i would not necessarily want to say that to underwriters at this point ) .
i do have some strategy questions for david about the disposition of the cargo currently in thailand and will give him a call tomorrow morning at 9:00 a.m. houston time to discuss .
although i know that is quite late for you , you are more than welcome to participate ( just e - mail me a telephone number at which you can be reached , or give me a call at that time ) .
- please see below cliff bennett 's recommendations for joint testing .
the test results we have to date of the thai cargo are somewhat inconclusive , but indicate lead and vanadium may be off spec , but principal reason for not delivering to first gas is uncertainty of d3605 as a test method .
certainly sufficient to enable the best chance of establishing the cause .
to that end , i would recommend that you provide the other parties with the test methods ( astm d - numbers ) and state that these tests will be applied to retain samples from each of : 1 .
this will to a degree depend on the lab 's ability to get any particulates into homogeneous suspension and keep them there long enough to make a composite .
insofar as identifying the particulates , should this prove necessary , i think we need to keep all options open .
while it is always possible to perform unilateral analysis should disagreements arise , better to keep the parties together if possible .
but if you limit at the beginning the potential extent of testing that might be necessary , it can all prove meaningless .
i appreciate that testing cost plays a role in all of this .
would you be able to draw up a test programme based on your recommendations > below with the view to circulate it to all parties ( including sgs ) for their > agreement prior to joint testing ?
i think such a pre - agreed programme would be > most useful and would avoid any dispute on testing procedure subsequently .
depending on exactly what samples are available , testing may encompass both > composites and , in some cases , individual tank samples ( where particulates > are involved , the composition of individual tank samples even in a > laboratory can destroy the representivity of a sample .
provided the testing can be done to the > appropriate standard and the methods are available , any laboratory would do .
the above suite of tests should be run on all selected samples ( it will > almost certainly not be necessary to test all available samples ) in > duplicate .
this is more difficult to predict in terms of exactly what will be > necessary .
however , > we need to keep an open mind on this .

i will give some further thought to what might be required by way of > investigative analysis and revert .
at this stage , i suggest that all options > on the investigative side are kept open .

do we still have that sample available for retesting , and will a restest of it be included in the current round of testing ?
i wonder if i could put you in charge of making sure that all files relevant to this voyage generally are carefully preserved for possible use as evidence later on .
next week will be fine for a response .
the administration could potentially initiate a 201 investigation and if harm is found they can seek quotas or other alternative .
if the steel group has any ideas that we could turn into a document for administration use it would allow us to offer solutions and encourage other alternative courses of action .
after we review possible solutions we can offer , ken , jeff , or steve should make the calls to senior administration officials ( within the next two weeks ) .

the new legislation 's primary focus is the separation of the retail marketing activities -- which will be completely competitive -- from the electric utility 's regulated transmission and distribution activities .
the proposal advanced by the distribution cooperatives would enable them to create a joint venture to market electric power to retail customers throughout arkansas .
if a distribution cooperative decides to withdraw from the joint venture , it may compete with the joint venture for any and all consumers .
each distribution cooperative has a relatively small amount of the electric power generating capacity in arkansas , and the combined generating power capacity of the 17 distribution cooperatives is approximately 6 percent of the total generating capacity in the two areas of arkansas in which the joint venture is likely to market .
the joint venture is expected to achieve economies of scale that would give it significantly lower distribution costs in statewide or regional markets than would be attainable by individual members .
he commented that " while the distribution cooperatives could be viewed as potential entrants into each other 's local retail markets , regional markets and a state - wide market , their small size and relatively high operating costs make it unlikely that they could enter new markets on their own or that , if they tried to enter , they would offer effective competition . "
also , if you have added more transactions beyond your january 31 , 2001 summary , we would like copies .
they include a $ 34-million cut for the city 's general fund -- essentially a bonus for the utility 's owner -- and an additional $ 42 million in overhead for such things as debt payment and return on the agency 's capital investments .
this helped avert even more extensive blackouts than the state experienced .
top state officials , including the governor and treasurer , want the bond sale to go without a hitch , but the date of the sale already has been pushed back several months , and threatened litigation could further delay it .
the bill 's passage could be a " deal breaker " for the bond sales , said contractor joseph fichera , a financial advisor to davis .
the utility would have to handle on its own about $ 1 billion owed to large energy companies .
the utilities want the department to be subject to the sort of reviews that have rankled them for years .
if the puc does not provide for that , lawsuits could be coming .
around the state , more people are beginning to suggest that price is worth paying to help smooth out the ride on the state 's power roller coaster .
the amounts can be as low as 2 percent or 3 percent , or as high as 30 , partly depending on what gets called " renewable .
it is a debate that will help shape california 's power future , and it comes as the state has begun loading up on natural gas plants .
in a series of workshops beginning tuesday , it will seek public feedback on a proposed 10-year plan that would raise that amount to 10 percent by 2006 and 20 percent by 2011 .
by 2003 , staffers would return to the board with a study on how to reach the far more challenging second phase : boosting green power another 10 percent at a livable price .
i think consumers are willing for that to be part of the mix these days .
the more important factor may be the davis - burton feud which manifests itself in many ways , but particularly on the two most important pieces of late - session business , the davis - sponsored edison bailout and a multibillion - dollar boost in benefits for workers with job - related illnesses and injuries , carried personally by burton .
the workers ' compensation bill , sent to davis ' desk last week , would boost benefits by a similar amount each year .
and another has a $ 60 bid , we may take the $ 60 bid because it would take longer to deliver the $ 50 power .
we are looking into a variety of issues surrounding that dysfunction and in due course we will answer those issues , " he said .
[ selling upses gives us a chance ] to fish for the integration portion - maintenance services , design , network assessment - for future projects , " ngo says .
even in a small business , the first time you have an outage , you could put 50 employees out of business for a day .
that could cost you up to $ 20,000 plus lost sales .
the global ups market is expected to generate $ 6.4 billion in sales this year and will see a compounded annual growth rate of 8.3 percent between 2000 and 2007 , says farah saeed , an industry analyst with frost and sullivan .
it 's a very mature market , and there 's a lot of competition with inexpensive products coming from abroad .
but ups vendors remain bullish on long - term opportunities that may arise from power - related issues .
it 's been said that good things come in small packages .
but thanks to technology advances , power - protection systems are becoming lighter , more compact and less expensive , say vendor executives .
the combination of market maturation and new technology is appealing to end users , says henry ngo , marketing manager at e - systems design , brea ,
calif. " products are getting better and smaller , and you can do more with less investment , " he says .
but if ferc orders refunds , these power sellers have reserved the right to seek refunds , which in some cases could amount to more than they ultimately owe .
when the agency sees that , it will be clear that they have opened a can of worms that they do n't want to get into .
attorneys representing power providers expressed the hope that ferc wo n't pursue refunds in the region .
we are in much better shape this year than we were last year , " dennis said .
perhaps most important , she added : " we do n't expect the kind of volatile market we had last year .
elizabeth field has both a gas stove and water heater in her stockton home , and , she said , she was delighted to hear that her gas bill should be down from last winter .
the company is expecting a decision from utah regulators on a separate $ 100 million tariff - increase request in the next couple of days .
well , i certainly would n't want to underestimate the pleasure of being able to select the perfect time to maximize one 's electricity consumption -- but will it be enough to compensate for the higher prices that will almost certainly accompany this deregulation ?
supporters of deregulation prefer to look at what has happened elsewhere .
vacuuming could become not only an exclusively late - night pleasure , but a luxury we can only dream of .
according to canciamilla , relieving socal edison of hundreds of millions of costs for state - purchased power could help the southern california utility finance $ 1 billion in debts to generators , which in turn would help make the bailout plan work .
a day after the state assembly narrowly approved the measure , the democratic governor said that although it still needs to be reconciled with a slightly different version approved earlier by the senate , he is confident the bill will clear the legislature .
i think that 's entirely doable now , since it 's passed both houses , albeit in different forms .
we obviously have a long way to go yet in terms of additional steps at the senate , but it 's good to see some momentum there .
both would allow the utility to float bonds that would be used to repay about three - fourths of the $ 3.9-billion debt
edison bought the power on the volatile open market for far more than it could charge its customers under a state - imposed rate freeze .
the assembly plan would give the state a similar option , requiring further action by the legislature before it could be exercised .
this has not been a good year for clear thinking about energy .

taking into account transmission and reliability factors , the procedure points towards profit opportunities that may be exploited by another industry participant .
an industry participant can use ege to spot and quantify efficiencies that would come from a merger or acquisition .
a power plant developer can use ege to estimate the incremental value a new plant will enjoy when the target utility 's unit commitment routines inevitably become rationalized .
with respect to a generating units ' average heat rate in the half - load , three - quarter - load and full - load ranges , it can be instructive to rank these relative to similar generating units within a region .
it can also be of interest to identify significant seasonal variations in average heat rates and maximum capacities , and changes in recent years in these parameters .
employing this real - world analysis as a pedagogic tool , elc , in a one - day seminar with enron personnel , would instruct how to perform the procedure in the future ( without the assistance of elc ) .

if the rr option does n't pan out , we may want to suggest to tino and dennis that our row people can handle this .

the governor still believes he can live within the existing rate structure , " maviglio said .

its approval is needed if california is to purchase the electricity transmission grid .
hebert could not be reached for comment tuesday .
he is working on similar deals with pacific gas & electric and san diego gas & electric .
if he would endorse the plan , " davis said , " that would be a leg up in getting ferc 's approval . . . .
sure , we have to be open - minded , but i 'm skeptical as to how this helps , " he said .
i am not looking forward to any additional regulatory burdens from ferc , " davis said .
whether the commission will approve a state purchase of the grid and how long it will take to reach a decision are unknown , edison international chief financial officer ted craver told debt holders tuesday in a conference call .
high energy prices can create strange bedfellows .
that 's good news to morpheus , which consumes some 25,000 kilowatts a month to test and manufacture huge performance lighting pieces like its briteburst , which has enough power to light 3com park and was used in the 2000 super bowl halftime festivities .
we are a utility that has resources in excess of our needs and that 's a nice place to be , " said jim feider , director of the reu .
several months before most californians knew a long - term energy crisis loomed , the economic development corporation of shasta county , which seeks to attract business and the wealth it generates , began to aggressively pursue small and midsize bay area manufacturing businesses looking to expand and relocate .
in the shasta county - area workforce of 84,000 ( 71,600 in shasta and another 12,400 in tehama county ) , a consultant 's survey has identified 18,000 underemployed workers who have the skills , education and experience that qualify them for a better job , said zauher .
first , a company has to decide the threshold question , whether it can operate in the greater redding area .
we are looking for smaller companies that could flourish in the greater redding area .
haerle has yet to reel in a company , but the path has been cleared by morpheus lights , which moved up nearly three years ago , and a handful of other small and midsize businesses in the past year .
this enabled the company to move from a 30,000-square - foot space in santa clara to one with 42,000 square feet in redding .
we can be anywhere , as long as it 's close to a major freeway , because the equipment travels by truck .
and we 'll have pg&e worked out .
davis was scouting for help tuesday from energy secretary spencer abraham on that front .
i hope by the end of the week he 'll be able to endorse the proposal or at least endorse a modified proposal that is satisfactory to us .
my office is so dark at night you could develop film in it .
we 'll have long - term contracts for power at greatly reduced prices .
the supplier 's offers last summer could have helped avoid blackouts this year
looking back , the governor may be regretting that he dismissed the proposals .
and duke said that if the governor helped speed up permits , the company could build enough new portable units to power an additional 500,000 homes .
davis spokesman steve maviglio said at the time the offer was made , duke 's proposal was expensive and there was uncertainty about how the energy crisis would take shape .
had the governor decided to help duke get permits for the new " peaker plants , " he could already be halfway to his goal of getting 1,000 megawatts worth of new peaker plants by this summer .
moreover , williams and others said it would be difficult for energy companies to meet davis ' goal of 1,000 megawatts from new peaker power plants by summer because , even under a new speedy permitting process announced by davis three weeks ago , it still can take months to line up equipment and get it constructed and on line .
the dilemma for california this summer shapes up like this : various estimates predict that the amount of electricity that will be available will fall short of demand by 5,000 megawatts to nearly 7,000 megawatts , or enough electricity to power 5 million to 7 million homes .
and even with a speedier licensing process , it might be difficult to get the other 1,000 megawatts of new peakers built in time for summer .
still , state officials are confident that the governor 's goals to boost power production from peaker plants and through increased energy conservation will work .
with increased generation and the reduction in demand , we should be able to avoid rolling blackouts this summer , " said energy commission spokeswoman claudia chandler .
chandler said the new peaker plants , which can be transported on a flatbed truck and can be as small as a large backyard storage shed , still could be running by summer if applications are filed by mid - april .
davis sees winning abraham 's backing of the plan as a possible key to federal approval .
i think that team 's assessment of the progress we 're making will have a lot to do with how washington responds , including the ferc , " davis said .
we 'll need federal approval and , hopefully , federal assistance on the financing of those improvements " in california , davis said .
under a settlement announced monday , the water resources department will buy power on behalf of residential and business customers that was previously being delivered to edison and pg&amp;e. ` ` we see this as progress .
supporters of the plan say it could lead to quick improvements of a bottlenecked system overdue for repairs .
' ' energy department spokesman joe davis said abraham is reviewing the proposal but would n't comment on whether he would endorse it .
some state lawmakers have said the long - term costs of the plan outweigh the immediate benefits because the transmission lines need repairs that could cost an estimated $ 1 billion a year .
` ` the third year i think enough generation will be online so that we 're in much better shape . ' '

inc. houston ( dow jones)--a working group within the southwest power pool identified six new transmission lines with an estimated price tag of $ 240 million needed to ease the region 's constrained high - voltage grid .
last week , the spp work group voted to proceed with a more detailed analysis of each project .
most of the new lines would take at least three years to develop and build .
spp 's transmission assessment working group has been meeting to identify needed system upgrades since march 2000 .
seventeen upgrade options were studied for their potential to benefit bulk system transfer capability .
as a result , there will be a need for new transmission lines , " he said .
spp , which seeks to gain final approval of its regional transmission organization this week from federal regulators , is ready to move forward to coordinate the planning process for new transmission , said marschewski .
spp has worked to coordinate generation outages to minimize problems , but if the region sees plant outages this summer , tlr events could occur , he said .
i 'm available any time friday , and tomorrow afternoon is fine , especially after 230 .

i also urge you if you were offended to watch the news , she will be up for reelection in 2004 and look for her opponents , democrat and republican .
bryan , i am glad we could help .
amitava 's visit really appreciate your freeing amitava up to provide critical input into the quantitative work we have undertaken .
as you are aware much of the work requires exploring uncharted territory and the team has confirmed the significant contribution that amitava 's experience and expertise has provided in a very short timeframe .
as you might expect , this quickly confirms that we really need more dedicated support from someone with amitava 's background .
it is imperative that we leverage his experience to speed up the process and apply critical insights into our project .
this will not only speed up the work considerably but also ensure that we have put our best team on the difficult issues in front of us .
i would like to discuss an arrangement where we can ensure amitava is more integrated into our efforts .
this should allow us to develop the communication processes to run a global quant effort for the project and then continue with amitava a full time ec.com resource working from houston .

( david suggested at the meeting that , as another option , we could agree to a termination right due to an adverse regulatory order if peoples chooses to discontinue all hub transactions , but i am not sure that we need to offer this at this stage . )
the deleted wording of 7.2 should be restored , and to that section we could add a sentence :
as i understand it , the description of the services both for the agreement and the gtc may be changed to replace the existing references to transportation services a reference to " wheeling " serivces .
this means that the administrative fee could be adjusted retroactively only if a transaction occurs under a newly proposed rate which is part of the operating statement , but subject to refund at a level higher than the previously approved rate but lower than the maximum price under the new rate .
we could adjust the language of sect .
i would like to know whether the business people have comments on this .
therefore , i believe we should propose , at least , to restore the sentence through part a , subject to verification with laura and gregg .
such services should be offered soon under order 637 compliance filings .
david indicated at the meeting that , at a minimum , meh should be advised of changes in advance and provided with an opportunity for comments before such changes are proposed .
also , peoples agreed that section 5.1 should include a representation that peoples has provided meh with a current copy of the presently effective gt&c. 12 .
peoples agreed at the meeting that section 5.1 could be revised to eliminate the refernce to laws and judgments with a materially adverse effect .
i wonder if we can accomplish this result with language in a later section of the agreement regarding liability .
i would like to discuss whether there is another way to deal with potential liability without changing 2.9(ii ) to refer to " best " or " commercially reasonable " efforts .
we should discuss with the business peoples whether this is sufficient , and how specific this provision should be .
i would suggest : " peoples will inform meh promptly after it learns of information indicating that a revision to information regarding hub capacity should be made or proposed in accordance with this section . "
tomorrow , i will re - review my notes to make sure that i have covered the regulatory areas .
i have notes on other sections also if you have any need for them .
i 'll give you a call tomorrow after i return from a morning hearing around 11:00am .

the new york mercantile exchange , inc. ( nymex ) , and chicago mercantile exchange inc. ( cme ) today announced at a joint news conference in new york that they have reached a cooperative agreement to offer newly created " e - mini " versions of key nymex energy futures contracts for trading on cme 's globex electronic trading platform and clearing at the nymex clearing house .
the first e - mini energy contracts will begin trading in the summer , officials of the exchanges said .
modeled after cme 's popular line of e - mini stock index contracts , which are one - fifth the size of the standard - sized contracts , the new e - mini energy and precious metals futures would be a to - be - determined fraction of the size of the standard - sized nymex contracts .
similarly , nymex members will receive access to globex and discounts on fees for cme products traded on globex with a cme member firm guarantee , and for the e - mini energy products with the guarantee of a nymex clearing firm .
the exchange officials said that a cross - margining program will provide capital efficiencies for market professionals and proprietary accounts by combining the positions at joint or affiliated clearing members in baskets of cme and nymex or comex division commodities , the new e - mini energy products , and gsci * futures and options into a single portfolio .
this is an innovative new development in the futures industry that builds on the long - standing relationship between our exchanges , " said cme chairman scott gordon .
by reducing the size of the contract unit , we hope to emulate the cme 's success in expanding the trading community for our most liquid markets .
by expanding globex distribution to the nymex floor and leveraging our existing distribution channels , we hope to build on our previous success , enhance market liquidity and expand the customer base for energy and , potentially , metals futures .
unlike their standard - sized counterparts , the new e - mini products will be cash - settled to the respective nymex futures contract month final settlement price on the last day of trading .
under the agreement , market participants interested in trading the new products will be designated " qualified " if they are guaranteed by a nymex clearing member firm .
in addition , nymex members and customers trading the new products on globex will have access to cme 's electronically traded products , subject to the guarantee of a cme clearing firm .
in addition to the extensive distribution network and connectivity alternatives of globex , the exchanges will work together to provide nymex members and customers with access to globex , both on the nymex trading floor and around the world .
nymex and cme jointly developed clearing 21 * , the clearing platform operated at both exchanges for high - volume , high - capacity clearing and settlement of exchange - based transactions .
as an international marketplace , cme brings together buyers and sellers on its trading floors and globex around - the - clock electronic trading platform .
any forward - looking statements made by , or on behalf of the exchange , involve a number of risks , trends , uncertainties , and other factors which may cause actual results to differ materially , including the exchange 's receipt of the necessary commodity futures trading commission approval ; timely performance and cooperative effort of exchange partners ; and changes in financial or business conditions at the exchange .

can you help martin w this thanks -----

however while the above time limits have been ' agreed ' , it have also been developing project omni which as i understand it will replace lotus notes with outlook .
the ultimate interaction between the technical parameters ( 100mb ) together with the time limitations ( number of days ) will have to be worked out .
with respect to the issue of recycling and back up tapes , once we have a reliable archive system in place we can move to eliminate the back up tapes for received emails and recycle them in a similar fashion to houston .
however it should be noted that whatever archive system we decide to use , whether it be livelink , ivault or some other system , we will also have some sort of back up system for the archive whether it be tapes or through some other type of mechanism .
hopefully this addresses a few of the concerns which were expressed .
a night out on thursday sounds really good right now - maybe i will see you .

hi ken , would you please add paul y'barbo on this distribution list .
a good heads up on alliance ..
extremely strong gas demand in the pacific northwest , california and in the midwest has produced continued high load factors on transcanada and pg&e gt - nw despite the presence of their huge new rival for western canadian supply .
the big picture overview that i would give you is that demand is very high in the pacific northwest and california and we continue to run at the highest possible load factor down that leg of our pipeline system out of alberta , through british columbia and into the pg&e systems .
it also continues to operate at high load factors .
customers are making frequent intraday nomination changes and we 're seeing more up and down and day - to - day variations , according to the weather and the markets , than we would have when we had a higher firm contract level .
he also said the pipeline soon would be testing to increase flows on the system .
it has been estimated that alliance could increase gas flows to 1.5 bcf / d with existing compression .
the additional capacity would be divided up among existing shippers , crawford said .
in order to keep members updated on possible avenues of financial assistance , we have listed below the phone numbers and contact information to both the nys and nyc economic development corporations .

i can give you my assurance that any increase in var day to day will come from price movement , not increase in position .

but attention continues to focus on the hart senate office building-- which could remain closed for several weeks , depending on what method technicians decide to recommend to remove anthrax from the building .
in making the decision , leaders and their technical advisers must decide whether it is better to inconvenience a large group of senators -- to get the entire building up and running sooner -- or a smaller group , to let the rest return to work .
we want to be able to completely reopen all the contaminated areas as quickly as possible and still access the building as quickly as possible , " he said .
daschle indicated late thursday that , if possible , the plan would be to remediate the entire building at once .
he indicated a decision would be made in the next couple of days .
some sources have envisioned an upside to the dislocation and inconvenience of so many senators : it could add pressure for adjournment next month .
rep. sue myrick , r - n.c. , acknowledged that smaller firms have suffered from globalization for years for a variety of reasons-- but added that large , older firms are starting to cut payrolls for the first time in memory .
those measures could include a tariff , quotas or other steps .
as the industry considers restructuring to adjust to increased competition , the itc will prepare a recommendation for presidential action .
after making only halting progress this week , appropriators say they will have conference reports on fy02 energy and water , va - hud and legislative branch bills ready next week .
young and others also have said congress could provide further supplemental funds either early next year or later this year , because the $ 40 billion package enacted in the wake of sept. 11 is widely acknowledged to be only a " down payment " on the cost of recovering from the attacks and fighting the war on terrorism .
$ 5b plan for manhattan new york democratic sens .
while any number of modifications are possible from there , the plan would be the marker from which a debate would follow , said a committee gop aide .
to spur more business investment , the senators are endorsing bush 's proposal for a 30 percent bonus on top of what companies can now depreciate and permanent relief from alternative minimum taxes for corporations -- but on a prospective basis only .
the measure also would include bush 's call for additional funds for unemployment benefits and aid to states to help laid- off workers retain their health insurance .
the aide said the goal is to stay within the $ 75 billion price tag bush wants , but the bill could cost a bit more .
the baucus plan would provide for $ 35 billion in tax relief -- much less than what bush has suggested -- and an equal amount in health and unemployment benefits .
the dispute has nearly halted progress on the legislation , which murkowski had hoped to unveil earlier this week .
according to the aide , oxley has tapped house financial services capital markets subcommittee chairman richard baker , r- la. , to head the working group , which also will include subcommittee ranking member paul kanjorski , d - pa . , as well as a developing list of industry and other interested participants .
the aide said the working group would meet informally starting next week to discuss and weigh the different proposals that are on the table .
we 're just really moving forward with the issue , with an eye toward developing our own plan .
gephardt also said that a strong airline bill would represent steps forward in economic stimulus -- another post - sept .
joked leahy , " the gestation period may have been a few weeks , but it 's better than giving birth to a monster .
instead , the legislators argued , the effect of the sunsets will be to make law enforcement all the more careful and diligent in applying those new powers , knowing that the congress will be watching .
a spokesman said they would introduce the bill as soon as the drafting is completed .
, the two have met regularly this week to discuss election reform -- and could mark up a bill as soon as next week .
the bill also could commission a set of uniform election standards .
thanks , call me with any questions or concerns .

it was probably pretty smart of delta to send those planes to cincinnati since as a hub they could probably get them on connecting flights to wherever they were originally headed more easily from there than anywhere else ( of course a lot were probably headed to nyc and the flights there the next day must have been packed ! ) .
aside from a quick one - day trip to new york i have n't had to do any traveling lately - i 'll probably be going to portland in early march and amsterdam mid - march .

tameeza asaria resume per amanda martin hi mike , amanda martin asked that i forward my resume to you for your consideration .
i am interested in a position in origination , risk management or structuring within enron .
i graduated from rice university and stanford university in engineering and have advanced into a commercial role at azurix .
i am hoping to build on my commercial skills at enron global markets .
i would appreciate the opportunity to discuss my plans with you .
amanda will also follow up with a telephone call to you next week .
as i think you both know i have been active in recruiting at cornell for the enron associate program for several years now .
just a quick follow - up on my november 2 email regarding enron 's participation in the johnson school 's march leadership week and the possibility of doing a case study on enron .
wondered if you have had a chance to float these ideas with jeff or ken ?
i know you have lots on you plate .
we at cornell 's johnson school would like to establish a stronger link with enron , a company which we believe to be a leading example of the agile organization which will dominate in the dynamic , unpredictable markets of the next decade .
one connecting point which we would like enron to consider is with our center for leadership in dynamic organizations which draws faculty and students from across cornell and beyond .
we very much would like enron to present what we call a " live case study " at the corporate conference on < underline
alternatively , this is the kind of event that is made to order for jeff skilling or ken lay and would give them a chance to interact with other corporate leaders and the cornell community .
if jeff or ken wanted a platform for telling the enron story , this would be a good one .
if they ca n't do it , hopefully we could convince you to do it .
the second proposal is to develop a teaching case on enron along the same lines .
in fact , if we started working on the teaching case soon , it could become the basis for the march conference live case study presentation .
we believe that enron is unique in its ability to literally create new markets .
we would like to devote a small research team to building this case about enron , directed by myself and professor lee dyer from the ilr school .
we would need access to a number of people in the enron organization , but are very aware of the demands on time for fast moving organizations and are committed to doing this in a very efficient way .
kevin , we appreciate your willingness to entertain these two ideas and hopefully test them with your top leaders .
we will do anything we can to make it feasible for enron to engage with us on these two initiatives .
please let me know what i can do to help you carry this forward .
as always , thanks for your great personal support .

specifically , brazos is considering a number of capital projects aimed at securing long - term power commitments to fill short positions associated with the southern arrangement rolling off in 2003 .
based on their experience w / the cleburne , tx facility , brazos appears to be committed to controlling their own destiny , and might find it much easier to fund marginal projects with an all - in cost ( or collateral value ) that is closer to market .
also in conjunction with point 1 , brazos has been working with a number of potential energy suppliers to secure long - term power commitments .
it appears to us that they are preparing to sign some form of commitment next week .
we are giving a great deal of thought to the notion that a third party might be willing ( and able ) to pay considerably more for this asset than brazos given its ppa , gas market conditions , and dispatch profile .
there are tax benefits associated with this asset that could be effectively monetized in a transfer of interests .

i 'd like to get together as a group and discuss both commodity logic & dcaf projects and see if we can put together a joint high level vision for supporting the trade clearing functions .
i 'd like to meet asap and would be willing to buy lunch if that aids us in getting this scheduled sooner than later .
i also believe his skills would be best used by developing some more detailed analyses
by the time we acquire these assets , both will be receiving srac energy prices .
as part of this process , we need to be able to quantify ( as best we can ) what impact current puc discussions will have on the switch from srac to px .
specifically we would like an opinion on the following :
this can be in the form of a timing probability .
based on what you know on how these discussions are moving forward , can you lay out a best case , worst case and most likely scenario .
a summary of the possible equation for calculating the new px pricing would be helpful .
you mentioned the possible transition from a transmission losses discount to a gmm adjustment .
any comments you have on these discussions would be useful .
any other comments you may have in regards to the above or the due diligence efforts in general would be appreciated .
thus , no single measure suffices , and a combination of measures can be useful .
and i would be willing to help as long as i do n't have to spend any time or money .
the best source for this kind of help would be steve kean and mark palmer .
but i think that this should be followed up .

we do have an isda agreement in place between koch energy trading and ena , but anthony is correct on a number of accounts .
it is a local currency form and could not be used for any non us transaction .
lastly , it has the old " erms " style collateral annex , and we would want to use an isda credit support annex on a going forward basis .
i would suggest contacting matt dawson in london legal and rod nelson in london credit and getting a new master based off our current form .
yes i realise the entities are going to be different if this turns out to be a ena isda but the by already having an isda with the counterparty we can quicken the negotiation process , i.e. ' mirroring ' the contract as you say , and having the correct entities in place .
i 'm glad you had a great time .
it meant a lot to lisa and me that you were able to spend the entire weekend with us .
i hope you felt the same way .

during the next few weeks , we 'll bring you behind - the - scenes looks at its development , stories from the treo design team , a sneak peak at some features and a whole lot more .
if you carry around a mobile phone and an organizer , you 've probably wished someone would figure out how to combine them both into one small device .
but successfully combining these devices involves much more than simply fitting them all into a single unit .
sure , you might get a good phone , but probably at the expense of a decent organizer .
a good mobile phone needs to be small , but organizers and web browsers need to have reasonably - sized screens to get the job done .
and a numeric keypad is great for dialing numbers , but challenging for text entry .
the team wanted a device that looked and felt comfortable as a phone , but also worked perfectly as an organizer and wireless data device .
the team began to consider everything that was possible in a combined phone and organizer that could not be achieved with stand - alone devices .
in the weeks to come , we 'll show you some of the unique features that resulted from this successful integration , along with the thinking that went into them .
once you 've created a to do item , you can still add more details if you need them .

enron may get new boss houston chronicle , 01/25/2002 enron 's new ceo could could be savior or victim associated press newswires , 01/25/2002
- enron corp. executives enticed wealthy investors in one of the partnerships that helped wreck the company with the prospect that inside knowledge could help double their money in months , the online edition of the new york times reported on friday .
previously , cooper was a partner in the accounting firm touche ross & co. cooper could not be reached for immediate comment thursday night .
carol coale , a houston - based natural gas analyst at prudential securities , does n't think the search for a new boss at enron should range outside the energy industry .
the energy industry is diverse enough where you could find the right person that has knowledge of energy , " coale said .
the creditors ' committee , in a prepared statement , said it was pleased by lay 's exit .
enron 's new ceo could could be savior or victim by kristen hays associated press writer 01/25/2002
presumably you could think the bulk of the bad has come out .
but anyone willing to take the chance - or seize the opportunity - likely has a thick skin , he said . '
enron said it will search for a restructuring specialist to serve as interim chief executive and help the company survive the biggest bankruptcy in history .
william brandt jr. , president and chief executive of development specialists , a chicago - based firm that helps distressed businesses rebound , said enron 's next ceo could be a trustee appointed by the judge overseeing the bankruptcy in new york .
the lure would be the reputation boost that would come from saving a company from such a huge , controversial downfall , he said .
calvin said lay could have prevented enron 's failure , but that others could have as well .
for example , by estimating that the price of electricity would fall in the future , enron could book an immediate profit on a contract .
jackson said that houston - area ministers and members of his rainbow coalition will unite in prayer as a sign of support to help rally for financial assistance for the enron employees left jobless and with shriveled 401(k ) accounts , which were mostly invested in the now bankrupt company .
before the rally , jackson met with business and community leaders to see what more could be done for the fired workers .
job search help enron is helping laid - off workers look for jobs by posting their resumes online .
employers looking to hire workers can post their job openings on click2houston .
some lawmakers and pension specialists are wondering if the enron case will be for the 401(k ) plan what the studebaker case of nearly 40 years ago was to more traditional company pension plans .
the good news is congress is now interested , " pomeroy said .
jon corzine ( d - n.j. ) , would limit employee contributions in company stock to 20 percent of the total and employees could convert any matching company stock to another financial instrument within 90 days .
companies also could choose to provide no match .
defined - benefit plans , promising a certain amount of money for life upon retirement , are far more easily regulated than 401(k ) plans , whose results depend on market forces and individual choices .
but over that time , the number covered by 401(k ) , or defined - contribution , plans has far exceeded those covered by the more traditional defined - benefit plans .
the shift from the defined - benefit plan to the defined- contribution plan has left employees with a great deal more exposure than they had under traditional pension plans , " pomeroy said .
it also dabbled in unrelated areas , like a plan to build a high - speed broadband telecommunications network and signing a 20-year deal with blockbuster video to sell video on demand .
it will be helpful to make sure we have complied with the policy .
-the enron case already has produced several book deals , with publishers hoping to replicate the success of " barbarians at the gate , " the best seller about the fall of rjr nabisco .
houston boys and girls clubs center that was funded in part by bankrupt enron corp. will remain open after a businessman agreed to donate $ 1 million for its operation .
but so far , the administrator has only been able to reach agreement on valuations with 12 of enron australia 's 37 counterparties .
mr. sims said that " the administrators would recommend that the company be placed in liquidation at the meeting of creditors on 29 january .
legal advice suggests that in the event of liquidation , the liquidator may upon application to the court , force the counterparties to close out , " enron australia said in the same statement .
the enron case already has produced several book deals , with publishers hoping to replicate the success of " barbarians at the gate , " the best seller about the fall of rjr nabisco .
we hope this will resonate with people who liked ` barbarians at the gate , " ' doubleday spokesman david drake said thursday .
on its internet site , wiley also is pitching " the financial numbers game , " a new advice book the publisher says will help readers " avoid an enron scenario .
last summer , as enron executives began cashing in their chips , it seemed they knew that they probably could n't sustain similar profits through another winter and that a wave of gamblers ' debt was coming due .
we would like to have the full text to the second paragraph of the floating price difinition included so the customer sees it up front .
fortunately for me and my family , i also received an offer with another company yesterday , and i have accepted that offer .
fyi - in case you might need it or are just interested .

i am not going to be in the office tomorrow , but i would like to send the msa to eden the following week .

i 'm able to make it to dinner tomorrow night for the tiger team deal .
: we have enclosed the initial draft of the llc agreement for ca energy development ii , llc , marked to reflect revisions from the llc agreement for ca energy development
tana , we need to add another amendment to extend the contract between enrononline and ft energy another 3 months .
i would like to take a final look either tonight or early in the morning .
the stimulus package is expected to be on the house floor later next week .
this is a positive development because it puts us in the very best negotiating position as the focus moves to the senate where there is less unanimity on repealing the corporate amt .

please review the proposal and comment as necessary , as agreeing upon a common premise will help us move forward more efficiently .
we will be meeting again later this week to discuss the various options that are available , and would appreciate your feedback with respect to specific structures , definitions , etc .
you may have in mind ( and that we may not have captured here ) .

i look forward to seeing you at damian 's at noon .
at the request of the neb , transcanada has sent out a notice to shippers and interested parties for comments on tcpl 's application addressing the proposed mainline services and pricing settlement .
behind the scenes , i recommend that we work with sithe 's legal counsel to coordinate a response to this request in case this capacity is assigned to enron at a later date .
there are several features to the settlement that may create additional value that has not yet been captured in our restructuring analysis .
if some , or all of sithe 's capacity can be turned back to the pipeline , value may be created starting in late 2002 and possibly through the termination of sithe 's contracts .
if there is any other information needed or i can assist in any way , please call me at x31667 .
, i hope , wilson , purchase and hubert ; and b ) a more detailed briefing note which outlines : i ) key developments since april 4 , ii ) our position re market opening and the key issues that have been raised against opening the market this fall , iii ) differences between california and ontario ; and iv )
enron 's assessment of the possible difficulties in nyc this summer .
one piece that i think needs to be added to the detailed briefing note is an overview of enron 's current commercial position in ontario - i.e. the renegotiation of the be contract and the likelihood of pursuing a retail initiative .
you will see where i have left space for that piece , hoping that you could draft it .
i have endeavoured in the outline of the speaking points to focus on what we know the key issues / concerns for the government are at this stage .
i have asked sasha jacob to provide us with profiles of harris , wilson , purchase and hubert to include in the final briefing package .
i have prepared the material on the assumption that the best use of the meeting time ( likely 45 minutes with harris and 60 minutes with wilson et al ) is : a ) to make the case for proceeding with market opening this fall if the imo and oeb reports re market readiness are positive ; b ) to provide harris et al with our perspective on developments in the u.s. ( particularly new york and california ) about which the government may have continuing concerns ; and c ) to ask harris what we can do to help the gov't move forward to a market opening this year .
i would appreciate your questions , comments and suggested revisions .
jennifer lowry along with andriy mysyk will be providing project management services .
andriy and matthew minyard will provide business object expertise whereas jennifer will provide smalltalk support for this project .
louise , i am under the assumption that we should be moving forward with the sale of pluto / megs to duke energy field services as well as the sale of the napoleonville land to texas brine .
in addition , i am trying to work out a transaction to sell the pad gas in dow wells 13 & 14 to an outside counterparty that would be leasing that storage capacity from dow .
harry : could you forward along to the ees folks we talked to yesterday who 're interested in iso 's demand - side proposal .
the iso would especially like to thank the participants that submitted bids that included back - up generators into the first drp rfb and encourages those participants to submit bids for this revised rfb .
as mentioned in the march 30 market notice for the second drp rfb ( for loads not using back - up generators ) , the design of the back - up generator program has changed somewhat since the issuance of the first drp rfb .
loads using back - up generators will still be dispatched after the drp load blocks but will be available for 24 hours per month , similar to the load portion .
successful bidders will start in the program either june 1 or july 1 depending on how quickly contracts and logistics can be finalized .
we hereby request that ena and ppl provide or confirm as applicable the relevant wire transfer information in sections 3 and 4 of part i , in order that execution copies may be circulated for execution later today .
i believe we also want to address an issue regarding assignment , but we are still discussing mike 's version internally .
kent , i look forward to talking to you tomorrow at 300 cst .
if you would like to discuss any of this in the am , please give me a call .
to help you live a happier life summary of july 22 , 2001
i am so glad you are here today .
i was hoping you would be here because i have something to say just to you .
not only that , i want you leave here with an ability to see the world in a new way .
i do n't want you to leave here feeling smug because your prejudices have been confirmed .
plus , we can talk ourselves into almost anything we want .
life is fragile and should be handled with care and prayer .
this pace of life sneaks up on us and we get seduced into thinking that just because it 's possible , we need to be doing it ; that if we do n't get with what everyone else is doing , we 'll be left behind .
that wonderful passage in the old testament that i 'll bet all of you are familiar with
the opportunity for abundant life surrounds you where you are .
if you can see , right now , how worthy and wonderful you are , you 'll not be depressed when approval is withheld as it surely will be .
the way it looks and feels .
i wonder what the jesus i know would say about a lot of the stuff we say and do .
be that as it may , this church will be the kind of church for you that you want to the precise degree to which you exercise your freedom to be responsible for seeing to it that we are the kind of church you want .
we are to get new eyes in here so that we can see god at work in the world .
we get so distracted like martha , planning for the big someday , that we miss the fact that the future we have been hoping for is right here , right now .
to live with no eye on the future is to live with no meaning in the present .
our critical task , it seems to me , is to learn the difference between filling up a day and fulfilling a day .
and that this kind of living is available to you and me , that it is possible for you and me , is the best news you could possibly ever hear .
i want you to hear the good news , best news you ever heard :
i can not think of better news than that .
let this news transform you so that you begin to see the world in an entirely different way .
a woman who had been in the gallery confronted him in the parking lot begging for his help .
i am so glad you 've been here today .
i was hoping you would be here because i had something to say just to you .
i hope you 've heard it as the best news you ever heard .
if this looks acceptable to you , please sign two originals and forward them to me .
and i 'll give you a piece .
i hope you will find this as interesting as i
and never even get a thank you for the >
> > i would hope that each of you would send this to >
erica , i need to make some changes to the list of e - request approvers .
phillip love should now be the approver for all tds and sitara requests related to the east and vng regions .
scott palmer will be responsible for tds and sitara for wellhead , central and chicago regions .
got some agreement on headcount analysis form wes today and will confirm with all other business units tomorrow so jenny 's budget will be accurate and the projected 2002 headcount accurate as well .
the good news is that you know the total and they agree with the total .
when this is better in a few days , i will e - mail you a new sheet like the one we showed you that has new expenses , new capital and the total it depreciation number .
as i mentioned the prior manager has interest in returning .
another alternative would be to hire a male manager that could do more make readies and lawn care .
lien 47,292 2nd lien 23,694 cash flow 29,014 cash on cash 200 % these numbers are using the conservative noi , if it comes in at $ 115 k then cash on cash return would be more like 300 % .
this does n't reflect the additional profit opportunity of selling the property in the next few years for a higher price .
in this case , j aron is transacting via either a different legal entity in london or a branch of the entity that was initially approved that is located in london with a password acquired on the basis that they would be trading from new york ( presumably from a u.s. corporation ) .

last year , enron established its first japanese venture , e power , to try to break into japan 's electricity market that since march has allowed non - utility firms to supply power to large - lot industrial and commercial users .
asked whether enron planned to buy or build a power plant in japan , lay said the company believed there was surplus capacity in japan on which it hoped to draw .
enron set up a second subsidiary in may , enron japan corp , with the aim of seeking business opportunities other than electricity supply in japan , mainly through enrononline .
enron 's package , which will typically run three to five years , will allow customers to " immediately " cut up to 10 % in their current electricity costs for the first year of the contracts , with the possibility of further reduction for the following years .
in addition to those main focus areas , enron japan 's hirl said there is " tremendous potential " in areas such as liquefied natural gas , coal and foreign exchange trading .
we 're looking to provide much services we can at the best price , and in many cases at lower prices , in most of the services we provide , " hirl said .
by offering " enrononline " - the world 's largest business - to - business electronic commerce platform , " enron can help the japanese economy become more efficient by significantly reducing the costs of many products and services , " lay said .

as you see , there is a need for developing a comprehensive fuel strategy for dpc that encompasses both the lng phase , and the naphtha side .
furthermore , any fuel strategy we develop will have to be in consonance with the power side of the business .
there is a lot of analytical work that will be required in this context over the next several months , and we will need a person who understands both the power and the fuel side of the business at dpc .
over the last month , his presence in houston has greatly helped me in melding the henwood study with the picture on the lng / fuel side .
i believe his presence in houston will be critical to us developing a comprehensive fuel / lng strategy for dabhol , together with the global markets and asset groups .

my resume dear vince , attached please find an updated resume of mine .
it seems to me that the framework i have been working on does allow addressing some fundamental issues and allows describing the salient features of power markets .
i feel a brief info may inform you what have i been up to .
i have been able to develop a machinery to capture this risk premium , and calculate its impact on pricing of other products .
in particular , the method allows consistent generation of hourly forward curve ( per each geographic region ) , hence generation of forward curves of longer duration .
it also allows one to analyze the sensitivity of the forward curve with respect to the volumetric risk .
as a fundamental input , i consider the ratio of properly compounded generation output ( load ) and the corresponding maximum available generation supply .
i have also realized that the transmission related factors may be incorporated into this framework in a very consistent and robust manner .
i have developed the first version of mathematical tools and prototype software reflecting all these issues .
nevertheless , i think i have developed a very systematic and robust understanding and methodology , and at least , i have convinced myself that this approach leads to a comprehensive system .
i wish that your presentation goes well with your new superior , and that my joining enron becomes a possibility .
will report back with any further developments .
sorry , i forgot to include you in the last email .
dear don , with the holiday approaching many of you are looking forward to a few days off and to spending time with family and friends .
seems to me we could put these under the category of potential losses .
i am sure you learned a lot from the experience which will serve you well on the next one .
enron 's analysis of bunge 's energy information indicates inadequate regulatory and pricing opportunity for enron to create additional value for bunge .
when opening dates are more clearly defined and we have confidence in energy curves for those markets , then we could revisit this area of your energy profile .
for those reasons , the opportunities are very limited for enron to apply a consolidation approach and provide compelling additional value for bunge .
i regret we will not be able to help bunge at this time , but know that enron will remain interested in assisting your company in the future if and when market conditions afford us that opportunity .
please feel free to contact me at any time in the future if i can help answer further questions for you or others who have been involved in this process .
dick , thank you again for providing your time and attention to this inquiry process .

the northwest may be a little damp , but the rest of the west remains dry and close to seasonal .
this weekend , as the east coast trough reaches maximum amplitude , the jet in the eastern pacific should start to buckle allowing for a weak ridge to form in the rockies .
we will be starting cold east of the mississippi , but should warm rapidly .
i suspect the models are a little fast and strong with the ridge / trough set up , but the trend looks good .
the mrf has a weak trough progressing into the midwest by day 10 and this looks reasonable .
in conjunction with a new " curve layout " requested by kevin presto , we will be carrying out several curve changes for east power .
i wanted to go ahead and send what curve requests i had available currently , but i will be sending additional ones as i complete them .

dear friends , as you may be aware , i recently began designing and creating my own line of purses made from cigar boxes .
while this began as a small , personal project for my own enjoyment , i quickly found encouragement from friends , associates , and even total strangers who expressed interest and enthusiasm for the designs .
and so , it is with great excitement -- and many thanks to my friends -- that i introduce you to my new web site , www.madebylynne.com .
i would love to hear from you with any questions or suggestions you have , and i hope you find something you 'll like !
if you want to take a wack at putting together a few bullets on what nord pool is , how it differs from cal model and why it 's preferable , that would help me immensely and free me up to focus on 1 ) comments to gov 's proposal and 2 ) more detail on demand buy - down .
the first is a presentation prepared for our mexcian colleagues 18 months ago , drawing out key features and success factors in selected liberalised markets , including nord pool .
the second overlaps a little with the first in terms of nordic content and compares the np arrangements to the existing and proposed new uk arrangements .
i would urge caution in using both of them to the extent that they are ( particularly the latter ) a little dated now .
let us know if you need more help .
also , i believe he hopes that our work will help convince the legislature to move to restore sce to financial stability - and to do so rapidly .

we are delighted to increase our ownership in trailblazer , which generates reliable cash flow and is expected to experience significant growth in 2002 once our current expansion project is completed , " said richard d. kinder , chairman of kmp .
" we have been interested in increasing our ownership of the pipeline since we bought our initial interest in 1999 , " kinder said , adding the company has been negotiating with enron for several months .
we began the $ 58 million expansion project in august of this year , as significant growth in rocky mountain natural gas supplies had created the need for additional pipeline transportation infrastructure , " kinder explained .
the expansion project includes installing two new compressor stations and adding additional horsepower at an existing compressor station .

re : bear guarantee letter hello team , i have good news .
although it could discharge its obligations under rule 10b-5 by disclosing the information to the counterparty , that would probably be unacceptable since the counterparty would then be in possession of material inside information and could not engage in a market transaction to hedge .
so i would counsel enron not to enter into any forward contract that has a cash settlement alternative .
but my bottom line is the only change i would make would be eliminating the net cash settlement feature in the csfb confirmation .

i am pleased to announce that a new feature is being added to the e - tag system : the potential adjust list ( pal ) .
an " adjust list " is a recommendation from the idc that describes what transactions should be cut and by how much to achieve needed relief to eliminate a constraint .
the potential adjust list feature adds a second , earlier adjust list that is sent out when the initiating sc requests relief , but prior to the confirmation of all the impacting scs .
this should allow this recommendation to be delivered several minutes sooner than it is today , giving more time for the market to begin searching for alternate economic sources and sinks .
control areas may elect to curtail different transactions or amounts than reflected in either adjust list due to local relief procedures or other business practices .
with their assistance in developing the concept , ironing out the technical details , and cultivating nerc support in the various forums , we were able to implement this change very quickly .
i expect this change to take place sometime between june 15 and june 28 .
if you would like more detail , please let me know .
i currently chair the group that is responsible for improving e - tag , and as such , am intimately familiar with tagging and its functions .
in the next few weeks , i will be working with don baughman and juan hernandez to ensure we utilize this feature ( and others ) to maximize the value of our e - tagging tools .
as indicated above , please feel free to contact me with any questions .
please note however that the phone number for the nerc help desk has been changed to 609 - 452 - 1661 .
you can access it on our home page .
sorry for your trouble ; please let me know if this method does n't work .
we 're getting some very positive response to the vrm approach .

but sophisticated individual investors can also apply to be treated as professionals if they have enough experience and a large portfolio .
there are a lot of things that could happen .
by dan freed one of the more interesting possibilities in the forthcoming appointment of new committee leadership positions in the house of representatives in the wake of last week 's elections - which has thus far escaped the notice of many in washington - involves a subcommittee chairmanship and a crucial piece of legislation .
meanwhile , the australian derivatives exchange ( adx ) said yesterday it was confident it would be able to open for business within weeks and a firm launch date would be announced as soon as possible .
adx is intended to be a fully electronic derivatives exchange with a global focus .
2000 securities and exchange commission chairman arthur levitt 's recent suggestion that the commission may ban trading and quoting of options contracts in increments larger than a penny has drawn considerable skepticism from a market data expert , who said that trading options in pennies would cause a tremendous strain on industry information systems .
during a speech delivered just over a week ago at the fordham law school in new york city , levitt suggested that the commission might mandate penny increments for options , just as it has for stocks .
increasing the number of options pricing possibilities by five or 10 times could generate far more message traffic than current systems can handle .
john panchery , who heads the securities industry association 's decimals conversion project , said that industry attention is still focused on ensuring that it will be able to handle the additional message traffic that will be generated when nasdaq converts to decimals in the spring .
he said it was too early to say whether trading options in pennies within a year was an unrealistic goal , or whether such a mandate from the sec might cause some firms to choose not to trade options .
sorry to bother you with this , but please see notes below .
i need to find out who i can contact to get information on our noncore accounts .

the intention is to use the testing on local hires ( not us nationals ) to confirm / expand on information gained in the interviewing process .
the bottom line is in my professional opinion these tests are an important part of a high quality recruiting effort ( and have been demonstrated as such in australia on several occasions ) ; unless there are significant legal impediments i want to proceed with them .

gentlemen , very sorry to hear the news .
i 'm opposed to millionaires , but it would be dangerous to offer me the position .
i think we have it backwards for james to dictate how and when todd 's help would be needed .
i think that we can review the " to do " list from james and get back with him on how much of that we can help with , who would do it , what the timing would be , how we might suggest organizing and prioritizing the work , etc .
as i said originally , i knew that todd would not be interested ( nor available ) for a month 's worth of work .
if james ' list looks long and involved , how could todd lead these efforts , what kind of team might he ask james to provide , what additional short - term resources might we be able to tap into in houston , etc .
we have to think a little out of the box to offer a potential solution to james .
if you are willing , i would be glad to explore this with todd and challenge him to think about how he could provide leadership to the effort , but not do all of the work .
i want him to think like a consultant on these projects , not as the contracted hired help !
i do n't see any huge problems with todd helping out continental power .
i knew as soon as i looked at her
hey girl , i know you 've been busy and i can certainly understand that !

it presumes that generation owners were planning on violating the pre - existing screens and counting on the revenue from those " golden eggs .
generators are not limited to receiving revenue from the spot market and may well choose to sell energy in the bilateral market .
one generation owner did a relatively " good " job selling a forward energy contract for the 6 month procurement period while the other owner did a relatively " poor " job selling a similar contract .
in the icap auctions they both should have the same strategy - maximize the revenue that each of them can receive out of the icap auction .
this is not a significant change to the existing rules and would seem unlikely to account for either a significant change in the expected energy revenue or the underlying value of the icap product . " ... significant uncertainty to the new york market ...
i am not passing judgment at this stage , but feel that all parties should know that the prices that were posted are in the process of being reviewed and that subsequent changes may be required to some or all of the months .
whether due to regulatory uncertainty in surrounding control areas or internal uncertainty about the exact effects of the amp , i believe that it is most appropriate for the mmu to take immediate action and refer it to the committees for longer term resolution .
since last summer there have been very significant > changes in the factors that affect the icap markets in new york .
the basic theory on developing a bid into the icap market for an internal > generator is that the generator should estimate the total revenue it > requires from the icap market to continue operating .
for > external suppliers the icap bid is based upon the opportunity cost of being > obligated to the new york energy market rather than being either obligated > to another market or having no obligations to any market .
clearly , in each case , the bid into the capacity market is dependent upon > the expectations of the new york energy market .
there have been several > adopted and proposed changes in the new york energy markets that make them > both less desirable than last year and less desirable than the energy > markets surrounding new york .
the circuit breaker / amp - the circuit breaker / amp creates both a concern > that the day - ahead market prices will be depressed from the levels that > should exist .
the implementation of the circuit breaker raises concerns > that the market prices in new york energy price will be depressed .
the > potential ways in which the dam prices could be depressed include failure to > incorporate changing unit operating parameters , fuel costs , or emissions > costs .
in addition to these questions about whether the amp will improperly depress > prices , there is still uncertainty to how a generator that has been > improperly mitigated is supposed to be able to be compensated .
bidding mechanism that is > being implemented this summer provides a sophisticated tool to a small > subset of market participants to determine whether they want to purchase at > the dam market prices .
this provides the possibility that day - ahead market > prices will systematically be depressed relative to the real time market if > this mechanism is abused .
each of the above measures has resulted in a potential reduction in energy > market revenues and added significant uncertainty to the new york market .
compared to last summer , > icap bids for this summer would have incorporated better understanding of > the expected profits in the energy market as well the expected impacts of > the price control measures .
extremely concerning- and we should discuss further .

there are a few remaining details to be worked out , but it seems pretty close , " maviglio said , adding that an announcement of the deal could come as early as today .
as we head toward summer , resources are going to be very tight .

it would probably come in the form of a surcharge on existing fees , but the monthly hit to consumers could be limited by spreading the total cost over a number of years .
meanwhile , the governor is pressing ahead with plans to purchase the transmission systems of edison and sempra energy 's san diego utility -- although what the state would do with only a partial power grid has yet to be determined .
paul patterson , an analyst at credit suisse first boston , noted that if pg&e had filed for bankruptcy after edison came to terms with the state , " they would be seen as a spoiler .

the deal is going well and we are working with the following hi - level parameters :
1 contract moving towards 0.5 contract and 0.2 contract possibly to match nymex mini concept , volumes for retail will be 0.5 contracts moving to 0.2 contract to match nymex mini concept data feed with price and volumes sent from enrononline to refco system customized and powered by enrononline software initially target scope is designed for a capacity of 5000 customers , 500 simultaneous refco will take credit risk for their customers and post daily collateral with enron refco will pay enron a one - time license fee for a 3 year contract with an additional annual maintenance & support fee enron will keep all additional margin generated by the transactions and refco will keep the commissions generated and float from additional margin held .
we are just beginning to model the potential revenue and cost streams and there will likely be some adjustments that will come out of this exercise .
there are also a number of alternative technology scenarios to pursue if we have more or less money to work with .
please feel free to call me x36413 if you have any questions or comments .
please let me if you would like this formatted another way .
let me know if you have any questions or need for me to make any adjustments .

i have made some drafting changes in this regard the most important of which is the carve out of the language in the eta which provides that gtc 's will only apply if an isda has been executed .
incidentally - with respect to the eta - it seems to provide that the relevant gtc 's will apply in respect of a transaction if an isda is not in place on the trade date of such transaction , however it does not seem to make any provision for circumstances where an isda / master agreement is entered into subsequent to the execution of a transaction .
in such circumstances on a literal interpretation of the eta , the pre - existing transaction would continued to be governed by the gtc but future transactions would be governed by the isda / master agreement .

with respect to your email below , i am already working with bob bowen on assigning the various aquila trades .
once i get that i can prepare the assignment .
i will also need the name and phone number for the amoco person i should be sending this assignment to .

i just wanted to clarify a few points mentioned in this diagram : 1 .
as well , ld language should not only be present but should be significant or market based .
from the diagram is looks like enron ownership would be 30 % instead of 12 % if that piece is considered debt .
i believe we will be in control of the structure .
however , we can be proactive and work toward keeping ourselves out lease land and structure this as and executory contract .

- federal reserve bank of new york president william mcdonough said on thursday the international financial system is showing some signs of strain from a slowdown in global growth .
the new york fed chief did not comment further on the global economy or discuss the u.s. economy in the speech , which focused on global financial stability .
he advocated a flexible case - by - case approach to crisis management , adding that regulators should strive for minimalist intervention .
speaking may 3 in frankfurt , germany , mcdonough said bank supervisors around the world should be working to enable banks to better manage their businesses and their risks .
notwithstanding considerable efforts at the public and private level to search for a better way , no magic bullet formula has been found .
if history is any guide , " he said , " new developments in markets and practices quickly will render obsolete those measures that might seem well attuned to today 's circumstances .
mcdonough said that approach , in his opinion , could make investors skittish and make it harder to generate support for honoring contractual commitments .
to sum up , i believe the one size fits all disposition inherent in the standstills approach risks making situations much worse than they need to be , " he said .
just as bailouts may encourage too much risk taking , efforts to orchestrate preemptive bail - ins may encourage too little .
as the hong kong market is becoming more sophisticated and more competitive , and as consumer issues are coming more to the fore , it is timely to consider whether the current arrangements in hong kong remain appropriate , " it said . .
the oecd report says japan may need to bail out the banks , a move the government has ruled out .
managing the loan clean - up will be a huge task for the authorities , in particular as flagging confidence may dictate that it will have to be carried out in a short period of time , " it says .
the timing of the clean - up is unfortunate , since japan is suffering the knock - on effects of the slowdown in the rest of the global economy , through lower exports .
it could also fuel japan 's spiraling debt burden which is projected to hit 158 per cent of gdp in 2006 - and 138 per cent next year .
on current growth trends , tax revenue would therefore need to be doubled if the adjustment occurred on the tax side alone .
another rival reported a similar expectation .
in a letter sent to shareholders thursday , mr. breuer said , " we want to expand our market position in all important areas of business in the current financial year .
investors will be watching closely to see if argentina can hold its next scheduled auction on may 8 .
it is the country 's bonds that investors will be looking at .

the way forward dan , in response to your question yesterday , it should still be possible to get a structural ruling from the irs along the lines that deutschebank ( db ) had contemplated .
i doubt it , but if not , we need to know so that we can move on and think about other ways to do a coal deal with pacificorp .
we just need to think in terms of what the landscape looks like in the absence of getting a new ruling .
one approach would be to follow through with our plans for pacificorp 's facilties , meaning we would relocate them , and continue running run - of - mine coal , the irs be damned , and just find an equity player with a greater risk profile than pacificorp .
in short , we would need companies who are willing to rely on pacificorp 's existing rulings , period ( along with an appropriate indemnity ) .
in addition , the irs announcement does not require a waste coal fine processing facility to pelletize its output , as some commontators had feared , which is a helpful development because the pelletizing process would be a tremendous drag on capacity .
however , there are real difficulties with this approach .
it seems to me that if they can be persuaded to lower their price expectations in light of the new landscape , since a new equity player is going to have to bear real risk , then we may still have an opportunity to do a synfuel deal .
sally , so sorry we have n't been able to connect .
here is the latest model that i have put together for the lm 6000 deals .

the commission has classified the investigation as a ratesetting proceeding and ordered the three?utilities to file a cost / benefit analysis on new transmission upgrades as well as their own ability to build new peaking generation for next summer .
the cpuc has authority over utilities , but cal - iso is the agency that is approving transmission upgrades to be built by utilities and complementary new generation to be built by market forces to hook into that transmission .
although the cpuc has not stepped fully into the new generation siting process -- so far , a procedure that has been up to cal - iso and the california energy commission -- it does use the transmission inquisition as a foundation to question both transmission and generation projects .
simply put , these core benefits must make life better and the job easier for it while lowering the technology 's total cost of ownership ( tco ) for the company .
the process of windows 2000 certification can help meet both of these demands .

i 've looked at it as much as i could and do n't know what to do to fix it .
i may go ; i 'll let you know .
i 've put the relevant documentation in the file .
the agreement includes endesa 's right to increase its interest in snet in the medium term in order to strengthen the cooperation between both companies and allow endesa to carry out its industrial development plan in france and europe .
the approval for endesa to acquire 30-percent interest in snet cements the company 's move into france , which is a major component in the aggressive expansion efforts endesa has been implementing this year .
endesa was able to beat out other bidders for snet , including france 's suez lyonnaise des eaux and germany 's rwe , due to the positive valuation of endesa 's industrial and commercial projects and the economic value of its offer .
ironically , this could benefit repsol as the company plans to invest in any companies that are divested due to the merger .
however , even though endesa may face expansion limitations in france , it is important to remember how large the company is in its home country .
thus , although france is very important for endesa 's european expansion efforts , the company is still a contender in other key markets .

amy requested that i check to see if we need to include him on the next dinner .
this was discussed as a potential option to ease the administrative burden on accounting .
there are potential system - wide impacts that need to be assessed and resolved before we go forward with this process .
rather than spelling out the exact terms here on the " how " , i recommend that we just say that third party effectiveness will be assessed by accounting on a consolidated enron basis .
for example , if we wanted to " book " a deal to a certain profit center , it could be done for any business line .
further , we can add new business lines .
i have attached the revised version for your review .
i do have some questions included within the document and would like your comments concerning those .

dear jeff , hope i did n't get this to you too late .
and i think you would like her , as much as one can like one 's competitors , as she is very knowledgeable , hands on , and articulate .
she will be a good board member for southern .
in order to be able to accompany the members of the legislature and regulatory agencies on the international study travel projects , the level of board contribution must be $ 30,000 per year , every year , regardless of whether or not the company sends a representative or is interested in the trip subject matter .
the idea is to make the conferences smaller , more intimate , more hard hitting , and hopefully more productive for the board .
hope this is what you needed .
good luck and let me know how it is going .
happy to hear you are ok , mark .
however , commodity may be a different story .
i would assume that you want to include the data center on the commodity deal .
the data center , if included , looks like it uses about 6 million kwh / year .
by some estimates , that approval process could take as long as two years .
this year it may well come in may
somewhere along the line , there may be a skunk in the woodpile .

to the extent you feel it is truly in ena 's best interest , ed and i are prepared to honor your wishes with respect to tom swank joining the mid - market group .

thank you for agreeing to write a letter of recommending me for the analyst program .
i thought i would send you this list so you could easily tell the ones that have changed on the master list .
we can figure it out towards the end of the week .

as the chronicle reported yesterday , pacific gas and electric co. hopes to hit its customers with all the costs it will accrue under a current rate freeze -- as much as $ 15 billion -- when the utility 's rates are deregulated in early 2002 .
asked whether utilities should be able to place a surcharge on future bills to recover costs related to deregulation , davis adopted a more conciliatory tone .
they are going to think about this and examine for next season .
but they want to be sensitive and will consider at change .
thanks for bringing this to my attention .
this could however fix to the requirement for the longer form guarantee , if the bank will take a plain vanilla short form enron corp. guarantee with the x - default .
in any event , if this concept is to be included , it similarly would need to be qualified to acceleration as a result of an event of default under the enron corp. credit facilities .
due to scheduling conflicts , this meeting has been changed to begin at 1:30 in 4194 , thank you .
maybe tanya , a math ph.d. can help as well .
the financial trading group is looking at a potential candidate for a general financial trading position in japan and was wondering if someone from your area would n't mind testing this candidates mathematical skills .
i feel it is important to test her grasp of the subjects she would have studied and know that someone from your area would be best suited in providing some feedback on this .
if you do n't mind , could i please schedule a telephone interview for 20 minutes or so ?
the ideal time is tokyo mornings ( so for example , at 5:00 in the evening houston time any day that you are available ..
we can consider this a final version for jose to send to the bot .
we may want to make some comments to support or refute items as the case may be .

the assembly today will see a draft of a plan that would result in huge rate increases for businesses .
7/13/01 rate hike may hit businesses -- businesses would be socked with a big rate increase , while residential rates could hold steady , under the latest plan to rescue southern california edison and resolve major energy matters the state has been wrangling over since january .
the proposal by assembly democrats likely will draw fire from business interests .
rates easily could triple for some companies .
meantime , the davis administration was wrapping up a plan likely to include further rate hikes to pay for $ 13.4 billion in borrowing planned this fall .
7/13/01 governor hopes ' new ferc ' will order refunds -- california governor gray davis thursday said he hoped the newly - reconsituted federal energy regulatory commission would order $ 8.9 billion in refunds for the state for electricity overcharges , despite a ferc judge 's report to the commission that the refund amount was too high .
i would like to believe the commission , with two new commissioners , will be more sensitive to california consumers and order all the refunds that are due , " davis said in a statement .
this may be good news to the people of alviso , since the plant would emit less smog than 89 diesel generators that would have been used otherwise .
7/13/01 cal - fed funding approved -- senate committee thursday approved $ 135 million for california water projects next year , including about $ 40 million in projects related to the joint state - federal partnership called cal - fed and $ 22.5 million for sacramento area flood - control work .

i try to be selective about sending out recommendations proactively , but in john 's case i am very confident that he will add a lot of value to whoever hires him .
on a different topic i was pleased to see that you will also be on the eprm program again in the fall .
i would recommend looking at john gordon as a very strong candidate :
i think he will make a terrific contribution to enron .
while i know enron does n't routinely recruit at gsia , john would be an ideal > candidate if you are willing to make an exception .
since > john has an engineering / energy background , he asked early on for additional > background reading about finance and energy .

hi jeff , thanks for the opportunity to talk to your group .
fyi , i recently talked to vince kaminiski ( my former boss ) while seeking advice on a career move that i feel i must make soon .
i am looking to expand my quantitative and commercial skills into core franchise of enron businesses and would appreciate an opportunity to talk to you regarding a position in the gas trading business .
( if possible , i would like to keep the discussions confidential until final decision to use paul 's reference ) .
and the illinois commerce commission likely would weigh into the mix , since dynegy owns illinova 's
illinois power co. any effort to strike a deal quickly also could be complicated by enron 's ownership of
traders are looking ahead hopefully to colder weather at the end of the month , in time for the thanksgiving holiday .
newpower said it projects the year - end customer count will be between 840,000 and 860,000 , of which the fourth - quarter increase is expected to be achieved entirely through marketing .
as the news hit the tape , enron shares , after being briefly halted , seemed to hunt for a direction .
many expect that if enron remains independent , more executive departures could be in store .
following the release of enron 's earnings last month , hilton had a hunch the company would likely write off additional investments as it had in the third quarter .
akron , ohio - based firstenergy will use proceeds for corporate purposes and to help pay for its recent purchase of morristown , new jersey - based gpu inc. .
enron was held up as a model , growing extremely quickly , and the recent financial disclosures are just a shock , " said kelly perl , a project director at new york utility consulting firm applied economic research .
initial price guidance had called for spreads as high as 2.20 , 2.35 and 2.60 percentage points more than treasuries for the five- , 10-and 30-year debt .
the stock swap is valued at about $ 8 billion , or about $ 10 a share , the new york times reported on thursday .
analysts , wary after last month 's surprise revelations , said enron may have more to release , but they were pleased it was finally coming forth with information .
an enron spokesman could n't immediately be reached for comment .
if enron wants to get back the market 's confidence , fixing that problem , one way or the other , would be a good place to start .
also , the creditwatch placement reflects the uncertainties surrounding the company and its credit quality in the short run due to the possibility of further unanticipated developments in the capital markets .
on the other hand , enron 's position would improve as its credibility within the trading world and in the face of its trading counterparties would recover somewhat .
chevrontexaco , which is expected to provide a substantial part of the financing needed for the merger , also stands to gain from the situation as it would retain effective control of the combined company .
most of next year , traders said , prices could move higher if there were a sudden rise in demand .
the only thing that would make this market bounce a little bit would be some cold weather in the east .

in the wings are several interested parties looking to snap up the company 's metals customer base .
there are people out there with the experience and the contacts who see this time as a good opportunity to get into the market , " a senior metals market source told reuters on thursday .
such a move for enron 's metals portfolio would involve the acquisition of an existing organisation as a vehicle , the source added .
any decision by enron or a possible future purchaser to offload its metals operations would be unlikely to see enron metals remain intact , traders said .
enron 's financial position could also prompt customers to consider other options , the first trader said .
jones)- enron corp. ( ene ) said it will restate its financial results from 1997 through the second quarter of 2001 , as the embattled energy company and dynegy inc. both confirmed they are in talks on a possible business combination .
later , enron said the sec would investigate the company 's " related party transactions , " including those with the fastow partnerships .
chevron texaco would provide an additional dlrs 1 billion injection at a later date , the times reported , while dynegy would assume dlrs 12.8 billion in enron debt , plus billions of dollars in other debt that has been kept off the beleaguered company 's balance sheet and has been a significant contributor to its current problems .
a merger would be a better route for the company , but would pose its own set of problems , meade added .
enron has a lot of nice attributes , it is a great trading and marketing platform and companies are certainly smart to take a look at it .
it would be much easier for dynegy or other houston energy companies to simply hire enron employees rather than buy the company .
a proposed merger could turn out to be a " minefield and there would certainly be a pretty sizable exposure .
it would definitely make shareholders nervous .
gerald keenan , a partner in pwc consulting in chicago , was skeptical about the proposed reports of a merger between dynegy and enron .
the only caveat would be if the bailout would have some kind of significant effect on energy commodity markets , " keenan said .
dynegy said today it 's in talks to acquire enron in what people familiar with the situation said would likely be a stock transaction worth $ 8 billion .
( updates with closing share price in fifth paragraph and closing nymex gas price in last paragraph . )
` ` you ca n't predict what your cash flow may be .
( updates with closing share prices in ninth paragraph and information on board approval starting in 17th paragraph . )
houston , nov. 8 ( bloomberg ) -- dynegy inc. shares rose 11 percent on speculation that the company may be able to buy enron corp. , the biggest energy trader , at a bargain price .
` ` a deal could provide dynegy with tremendous opportunity . ' '
it would provide another $ 1 billion when the purchase is closed , the new york times and wall street journal reported .
enron plans to meet with j.p. morgan chase & co. , citigroup inc. and other lenders tomorrow to discuss the merger plans and a possible increase in the amount the company pays for existing credit lines , according to bankers familiar with the matter .
a key challenge at present for dynegy is whether it can conduct enough due diligence of an incredibly complex financial structure to feel comfortable with a takeover .
while dynegy understands enron 's trading business as well as any company could , it still would seem to need time to review its trading book .
should it discover things it does n't like in the future .
the new york times reported that dynegy 's board approved a stock offer worth $ 10 a share for enron .
a merger of dynegy and enron would require the smaller company to take on the $ 12.8 billion in debt that 's now on enron 's books .
that would also help enron clean up its balance sheet .
i think that a firm like dynegy with a firm like chevrontexaco as partner adds the credibility that enron needs .

barep is prepared to sign isda master agreements with both ena and ectric and is actively looking to start negotiations .
to the extent that ena would like to trade with barep i would propose that ectric enter into the trade directly with barep and then have ectric either back to back the trade to ena or otherwise account for the transaction back to ena .
if this proposal makes sense to the rest of you i will need to know if it works from a regulatory and tax perspective .
please let me know if anyone else needs to give input into this issue or if there are any other concerns or issues that will need to be addressed to cover this situation .
can you clear such an arrangment with tax , trading and documentation , i 'm happy to play along .
from a legal and credit perspective it would be better to have one master in place and if the other enron office wants to trade with barep we can do it through the existing master and back to back the transaction internally .
radia , thanks for your note below .
in order to avoid duplicating work , a way forward could be to let ena and barep conclude their contract , whereupon ectric and barep largely could replicate the terms between the former in their own isda master agreement .
before sending you our draft , we would be grateful if you could provide us the status of your company as soon as possible .

one crucial element is lacking - a standardized short - term trading contract that will help large customers to pick and choose the best offer in the market , rather than remain shackled to a traditional long - term supplier .
efet members will create a " template " that could be used in all the trading hubs around europe , which are emerging as delivery locations for gas sold on a short - term basis , spicker said .
the standard contract is likely to be in euros per gigajoules and will enable counterparties in the trade to choose which domestic law - german , dutch or english - should apply to the contract .
since earlier this year , small amounts of gas sourced from the u.k. , the netherlands and norway have been sold on a short - term basis - instead of through traditional long - term contracts - for delivery in places such as emden and lampertheim in germany and oude statenzijl and bunde on the dutch / german border .

though lucent boss henry schacht made some optimistic comments on tuesday that helped send the nasdaq north , it also surfaced tuesday that lucent may try to sweet - talk at least 10,000 high - paid managers into early retirement to help with that promised turnaround .
for analysts and investors , that may still be good news .
both the journal and the times heard a calculation that if half the managers in question accept the buyout , lucent could save $ 100 million - but neither outlet seemed willing to bet the house on that number .

we may be able to make an argument for pass thru to all customers which would neutralize the impact on new business and we may be able to do it without a huge effort .
can you make sure that this increase will really only impact unbundled customers .
since transmission prices are regulated by ferc i would think that all customers , bundled or unbundled , would be subject to any increase .
also , can you give a time when ferc is due to rule on this issue and how long it will be , if comed 's proposed impact passes , before transmission rates might be affected .
to $ 340 which will have an adverse impact on ees 's book of business .
the problem in illinois is that we may face the same problem on transmission that we face with distribution where unbundled customers could pay more for these services than bundled customers .
thus , in addition to being concerned about our current book , this could adversely affect our ability to attract customers with our new product .
but these administrative details are important .

the deliverables here were to ( 1 ) obtain a tariff methodology via supreme decree that would make the company finance - able
tariffs approved gentlemen , i am delighted to report that sirese approved substantial increases in tr 's tariffs consistent with the law and regulation .
interest rate - we 'll get this back when we do a tariff revision and actual rates are used .
we need to see exactly what has been removed , but my thought is that if that means we are unable to provide some services ( e.g. lpg transportation ) or the continued operation of some liquids laterals , we should write to those producers affected suggesting that if they wish these services to be continued they need to appeal the decision .
again since this is capex we will get it back in the end on tariff revisions as long as the expenditure is approved on an annual basis in the sirese budget process .
we need to do a detailed study to develop an occ strategy .
we intend to fight this one very hard using all the external / independant help we can get .
as you are all aware our big exposure with the rate case was that the much needed substantial increase in liquids tariffs would not be approved and we would be subjected to some form of arbitary cut .
having got the big hike our job is now to claw back as much as we can from the above strategy in the full knowledge that the results of these efforts will be much smaller and hence managable increases .
i want to update my electronic file .

however , it will not be valid for points far out on the forward curve .
one can imagine a term structure of heding ratios that start at 0.67 and move to 1.0 , so that the back end of the curves would move together , but how fast it converges to one is anyone 's guess .

we will also review management 's progress in dealing with problem areas such as its exposure to the california energy markets and its dhabol project in india .

bolivia -- randy asked if we have ever done any research on whether we could do derivatives in bolivia .
i think we will run into the same problems we had last year with the gas trading proposal .
bob carter worked a lot on that issue but the commercial interest died before we saw any tangible results with the colombia political process .
but i think don does n't like the current structure of having to run his financial trades with argentine counterparties through houston .
as you know this may create a whole host of other problems that can not be solved as easily .
i will discuss with andrea today my initial thoughts on the issues raised by this proposal .
first the tax issues may make brazil a difficult place to make any money on a trading operation , tax will need to be brought in first thing to analyse the structure .
second , we may not be able to trade cross border swaps without regulatory problems , we will need to speak with antonio felix and others at tozzini to start reviewing the structure .
third , there may be significant currency issues involved that need to be reviewed at the same time we look at the tax and regulatory issues .
if we are able to overcome these issues then we will need to review the substantial legal and operational issues raised by such a structure .
the isda agreement , which would be in english , would need to be reviewed by local counsel to ensure that all of the substantive provisions including arbitration , limitation of liability and collateral structures would be enforceable in brazil when entered into with argentine counterparties .
operational issues such as who will be responsible for the negotiation of masters , drafting of confirmations etc . would also need to be addressed .
pat emailed though that they are now looking at an option structure .
i will let you know what i find out .
and i can update you on where things stand .

while we are pleased that current trends show reduced demand and lower prices throughout the west , we remain concerned about the potential impacts of high wholesale electricity prices on consumers and economic growth in california and the entire west in the hot summer months to come .
to ensure that prices are just and reasonable during the critical months ahead , we believe the commission can and should do more to mitigate wholesale electricity prices in western markets .
we share the commission 's concerns regarding the need to encourage supply .
accordingly , to prevent blackouts and contribute to a long - term solution , the commission 's comprehensive plan should adopt market mechanisms as appropriate and allow recovery of all verifiable costs to avoid discouraging availability of supply and investment in new generation and transmission .
we recognize that individual states and utilities are implementing demand reduction programs , but a broader , regional solution is needed to enable sufficient demand reductions in time for an expected hot summer .
we look forward to working with you to build upon the commission 's previous efforts to ensure reliable power supplies at just and reasonable prices for consumers in california and the west this summer and thereafter .
to ensure maximum relief to western consumers in the months ahead , we request that you take appropriate action consistent with our recommendations as soon as possible .
if you have questions please contact our staff .
thank you in advance for your cooperation with this request .
i will contact you to discuss your interest .

trading of enron shares , which sold for $ 83 a year ago but have changed hands at no higher than $ 1 since december , were halted friday and monday on the new york stock exchange for the sale announcement .
evans could possibly have bought the company some time , if nothing else .
o'kelly would n't say when bg last talked with enron and would n't be drawn on a likely date when the transaction will be re - signed .
nevertheless , o'kelly expressed concern that with enron in chapter 11 bankruptcy protection , the process of renegotiation could become complicated as it will involve a bankruptcy judge .
indian - based analysts reckon a cash offer close to $ 18 million would secure operatorship for bg .
but , a two - day international oil and gas conference in new delhi beginning tuesday may offer the opportunity for both sides to rekindle talks .
each energy merchant responded the best way it could .
but she warned the magic will be in the execution .
she is concerned that some companies may have difficulty raising additional funds through asset sales in what has quickly become a buyers ' market .
i do think there 's a good possibility
then the companies can focus on growth , but they can do it in a more balanced fashion , which means slower . "
market waiting to hear more during earnings season fourth - quarter conference calls , which will begin this week , will give some of the companies in the group another chance to outline goals for the year .
investors said they were impressed by the ability of company managers to react to the new credit requirements .
going forward , fleishman said he thinks it also is the companies with strong balance sheets that will be able to benefit from acquiring new assets on the cheap .
for the patient investor , the risk - reward looks pretty good , " said glen hilton , portfolio manager at montgomery asset management .
allan chernoff has been following that story for us and he`s got an update .
and if you start to see a lessening in those bankruptcies and start to see a turnaround in some corporate profits , i mean , that becomes a statistics from the bygone era , to a degree , and maybe focus forward , not backward .
it may not be tomorrow or the next day .
but , eventually , we will enter .
more details are definitely going to be coming out very shortly .
i think we will see more details and more hiccups on this enron , as well as other deals that go on , and other people who are connected with it .
in the next hour , we head back to the new york stock exchange and the nasdaq to find out what stocks are moving at this hour .
great -- thanks for the info .
except for a small amount of capacity we 're managing on a short - term basis [ owing to the topock lateral problem with pg&e ] , our west flow capacity is sold - out .
however , your instincts are probably correct regarding the practical use of the capacity -- if there is a market shift resulting is a significant widening of the east - west spread , then we 'd likely see fts-1 shippers with primary rights more fully utilizing their firm capacity , thereby frustrating any usgt attempt to access cal .
in other words , it is very unlikely that usgt will be able to move significant volumes to california under the $ .04 part of this deal , right ?
usgt will also have the ability to flow to california on an alternate basis at a $ .04 total rate .
gentlemen i wanted to provide you an update on the status of the refco private label platform deal .
to briefly summarize the discussion so far , enw would build a refco branded platform similar to eol that would be accessed by refco 's customers .
enron would provide transactable prices to the site with wider spreads and potentially smaller minimum volumes .
refco has a similar arrangement in place for fx with dresner bank and have announced a similar platform for bonds and securities with cantor fitzgerald / e - speed .
all that being said , they are anxious to move the discussion forward and we have planned a visit for them to come to houston in 2 weeks .
i will approach you all individually to get your feedback on how you would like to interact with them and when .
phase 1 would include the top 2000 accounts which are largely substantial institutional investors , locals , and high net worth individuals .
if this proves successful , phase 2 would be rolled out with products designed to attract activity from the smaller investors .
please do not hesitate to contact me at x36413 if you have any questions or comments and i will be getting in touch with you early next week to get your feedback .
we 're looking to the future and looking at comprehensive , reality based solutions to a long - term problem .

re : cgi proposal update greg and rex , thanks for the input .
here are a few points i think will help . ?
the option would be explored during a " make versus buy " analysis within csg 's methodology ( during the initial requirements and design phase ) .
i hope these points might mitigate any concerns over the rapid time frame of the proposal .
as the proposal is due on monday , i am not sure if there is time to engage a large number of reviewers , but i will ask csg to copy rahul and hopefully he can get appropriate input .
presentations to cms by potential vendors will occur on march 26th-28th .
we should think about who attends and at what point we might want to use our internal contacts to approach the client .
since the client is in the requirements phase , we should think about how we might want to support that process , given our approach to delivering systems solutions
i hope you spent a substantial part of your earnings supporting the arts in your local community , donating to public libraries , funding a scholarship program for low - income students in impoverished neighborhoods , or in some other way improving our community .
i 'm sorry to hear that enron 's on some tough times , hope you 're area is safe .
on a personal side , hope you , anne and the girls are doing ok .
otherwise , i think we should inform them we want to close the account .
also , i heard from them and my contacts inside tractabel that they should close thier deal some time next week .
but beau baker , who has worked at both guard and center , came in and played so well the longhorns did n't miss a beat .
that really simplifies things when figuring out how ut can qualify for a bcs bowl .
second , texas has to finish in the top four in the final bcs poll on dec. 9 .
i think there is a fair chance oklahoma will lose to texas tech in lubbock .
one thing that would be fatal to the longhorns chances of landing a bcs bowl berth would be for ou to win out , then beat nebraska in the title game .
if the horns win out and still finish below nebraska and oklahoma in the bcs poll or if they fail to finish in the top four , look for them to wind up in the cotton bowl .
coach 's corner coach mack brown said sunday the bowl championship series ( bcs ) standings are so confusing that he has told his team to " keep working to be the best team it can be because good things usually happen for the best team .
we want to play as good as we can play every week , " he said .

( 2 ) select will discuss with its billing department the possibility of using the 5-day payment provision in enron 's amendment to section 6.2 and advise carol st clair .
( 4 ) when we get very close to execution , select and enron will reconcile an attachment a , to include all outstanding transactions between the parties other than those that the parties agree should not be covered by the master agreement ( no one could think of any today , but .... ) .

update jerry and i went to east texas this weekend .

thanks heidi -- thanks for all of your good work in organizing our participation at both the republican and democrat conventions .
while i know that you 've worked with enron on many events in the past , i recognize the difficulties in dealing with some new " cooks in the kitchen " this time around .
involving the same transmission pipeline and geographical areas , the current pcbs found in pg&e 's interstate supplies are coming through enron 's transwestern pipeline unit at the california - arizona border from new mexico but are not at harmful levels at this point in time .
pcb traces have been found , and pg&e has been working with the local gas distributor in the area , southwest gas corp. , to test for signs of pcbs in the nearby barstow and victor valley distribution systems .
and the utility is planning to install additional filter separators at various locations along its pipeline .
it might be helpful to have information something like this in it :
the ta1 segment may be worthy of future discussion in the tx set work group .

jim - i had one more thought after speaking with jeff , and just wanted to make sure that it had been considered ( may have been considered and rejected by now ) .
customers could still switch suppliers , and might seek supplier who will not add on the 2 cents ( good for enron ) , but might meet the ratemaking principle that utility has been given reasonable opportunity to recover its costs .
nordpool philip -- i wanted to make sure that the offer memo on feb 98 still was correct for the nordpool .

provide real time , day ahead , and term trading ; scheduling and transmission reservations / services ; volume management ; settlements ; and control room services arrange for ancillary services related to native load inlcuding entergy oatt schedules 1 through 6 provide nlr and benton with a fixed price for energy and ancillary services through the life of contract provde nlr and benton with option to extend agreemetn for 3 additional years .
a substantial improvement in price would be necessary to receive further consideration .
if you can point to resources inside of entergy 's control area you may improve your position
you may improve your position by offering dynamic scheduling .
you may improve your position by including any increases in the cities ' cost for network transmission service over the term of the contract in your costs .
significant financial assurance would be required before the negotiating committee 's would further consider enron .
provided we can win the project , we 'd like to do the following : name generation to satisfy point # 2 use dynegy base load generation assets to dynamically schedule the nlr and benton loads name dynegy assets as network resources note that we have not talked with dynegy about any of this and any deal would be subject to mutual agreement and negotiation .
the market saw another upside corrective bounce earlier today , after punching to a fresh 6.5-month low last friday .
the market is still a bit short - term oversold , and i would not be surprised to see more of an upside correction this week .
if prices can break out of that aforementioned range , the direction of the breakout will likely be the direction of the next significant trend .
crop progress reports out monday evening showing very good planting progress in the u.s. weighed on the corn market today .
i would be surprised if there is much downside left in oil .
we could see a bull flag starting to form in sugar , on the daily bar chart .
however , if the aforementioned gap can be filled on the upside , that 's an important first step for the bulls in turning the market around .
this market is still short - term overbought , technically , and i would not be surprised to see a decent downside correction soon .
prices late last week pushed to a new seven - week high .
but bulls need to see some solid upside movement soon to keep what momentum they have recently gained .
bulls still have the slight edge , but look for more choppy trading in the near future .
prices scored a new contract high just monday , and saw follow - through selling today .

re : enron - azurix energy management services agreement thanks for the list of activities that will be performed for azurix .
however , it should be noted that if an enron argentine entity provides the services but requires assistance from a us affiliate , the income may be subject to us tax as well as argentine taxes .
to avoid the us tax at the argentine entity , the enron us entity could bill the enron argentine entity for services but the high argentine withholding tax on services rendered in argentina by offshore companies probably gives you a worse result .
therefore , we need to analyze the sourcing of the services to make sure that we have taken into account all possible us income tax exposure .
now is probably a good time to discuss with argentine management the direction of the business to determine if eas is an appropriate entity or whether we want to set up a special purpose entity .
first , it would be best to convert eas from an s.a. to a limited company .
this may or may not be able to be done without paying us tax .
if eas has any appreciated assets , such appreciation would be subject to us tax when contributed to the cayman island company .
please arrange a time and we can discuss these issues in more detail .
, i know you have been expecting this information .
please give me a call if you need further information .
please give me a call if you have any further questions .
initially , we are thinking of using eas , however we will have to run it through tax first to see whether there are any tax implications .
if there are , we will look into either creating an spc or using an existing company if the corporate purpose allows .
in addition to this , the matter was discussed with mike guerriero and he believes that given the nature of the business being carried out by the exxel group in argentina , alfaro - navarro would probably have the expertise to assist us in these transactions .
andrea and i would like to discuss this issue with randy and you as soon as you get the chance to read the material .
please give me a call if you have any further questions or comments .
if andrea calo will be in houston for the next two weeks and andrea bertone will be coordinating the pre - feasibility legal studies of enrononline in brazil , we need to approach argentine counsel asap .
please send me your thoughts with respect to local counsel as we need to discuss this issue shortly .
we need to aggregate where we think we have this opportunity and take action today .
dan indicated to me that sce appears to have a sizable deposit from us on hand ( around $ 20mm ) and is asking for more .
i would like to think we have them all in a deposit account on our balance sheet , but that is not likely ( although kim , cindy and mary lynne should scour that ) .
given the agreement is between ebs and the outside counterparties we would like to eliminate any mention of enrononline ( the only place were we feel it may be necessary is in the failover article iv ) .
if it is limited this would give us another opportunity to reduce the scope of the contract .
lets discuss tomorrow and see if we can get this wrapped up .
i think this is something we should consider .

incumbents are able to deny new entrants access to critical , accurate information across control areas .
the ability to withhold cbm to ensure reliability not only confers a reliability advantage for the transmission provider , but may give the transmission provider the opportunity to selectively withhold atc over paths and interconnections useful to its generation competitors .
the commission recently noticed a technical conference , to be held may 20 and 21 , 1999 , on the issue of cbm .
see capacity benefit margin in computing available transmission capacity , notice of technical conference ,
the commission observed that the load serving entities that own generating capacity within the pjm control area appeared to benefit from this practice as suppliers in addition to benefitting as load serving entities .

if you are an active employee on the validated milestone date , you are eligible to earn a lip payment based on your contributions toward the milestone .
your supervisor will communicate your actual incentive amount after a collection milestone is reached or at the end of the quarter and project targets for the next collection milestone or upcoming quarter .

in addition to maintaining and improving its annual dividend of $ 1.34 per share , franklin disclosed that , moving forward , southern company will implement a new business strategy , which focuses geographically on serving 10 states in the so - called " super southeast .
two recent and significant events at southern company set the stage for this pronouncement of a " new " strategy for the energy company based in atlanta .
yet now , even as national energy competitors grow larger and larger , southern company 's strong local presence and vertical integration approach may ultimately prove to be the smartest strategy of all .
the focus on unregulated power generation , through which southern reportedly plans to add another 6,000 mw by 2003 , most likely refers to subsidiary operations such as southern nuclear and southern company energy solutions .
this has been a lucrative business model for the company for some time .
the difference now - in addition to expanding from four to 10 states in the same region - is that southern may very well be on the right track and positioned to have the last laugh as the deregulation game continues to unfold .
of course , ferc 's policy is that transmission - owning utilities should " voluntarily " participate in an rto , but at the same time the commission would have control over southern 's market power in the region should the energy company ever want to merge with or acquire another utility .
the company 's vertically integrated model has been retained and there have been no indications that southern company faces a supply shortage .
expansion into other markets such as florida and california has expanded southern 's base , while at the same time the company has held on to its market share in its own region .
for all of these factors , southern company may prove to have one of the smartest strategies across the electric utility market .
while other companies have rushed to merge , grow bigger and expand across the country , southern has taken a more methodical approach , which may also get it across the " finish line " before many other competitors .
just a reminder i will be out of the office tomorrow , wednesday the 25th .
i am also planning on being out of the office on november 7th .

the judge considers it important to limit the scope of the proceeding to only those matters that should be before him .
i was therefore concerned with the vagueness of it and the possibility it could be interpreted in such a way as to limit our ability to bring offsetting claims in conjunction with the " finding 3 " that the judge must make in the proceeding .
what other possible offsets could he try to interpret out of the proceeding ?

tanya , we are very close to generating factors for all primary curves .
if anyone can help , please help .
it has been working for a while on this .
winston , do you think we are ready to calculate factors for us curves ?
for my power curves i am getting wti factors and for gas i am getting ng factors .
, i think all the primary curves should have their own factor loadings .
i was in the process of setting up sunil 's template for calculating co - variance on all liquids primary curves using the " factor loading " data .
i am concern that liquids var could conceivably be over or understated due to the absence of 11 other curves which are listed below .
so i can not call , but do you want to meet for lunch .
we have attached it for your benefit .

scheduling a session at the naruc summer meetings sounds like a good idea .
are there next steps you think we should take to encourage this ?
the primary message that we delivered was that there should not be any expansion of extortion by local municiapalities for right of way access ( that " just and reasonable costs " were being interpreted very liberally by the league of cities and other folks and that the true interpretation should be actual incurred costs ) and that we hoped naruc and these commissioners could support our position and promote positions that enhance our ability to expand infastructure without unfair fees or costs .
however , they both suggested that the naruc committee should consider having a session on the issue , possibly at the summer naruc meeting .
i expressed to him our interest in the building access issue as well .

research group can help with the structuring models used for trading .
i can coordinate for talking with people next week .
vince & bill - if you want to join the meeting , please let me or anita know .
hi everyone , i have run the model and , along with the contract briefs i have some questions & ideas .
however , the jc penny 's version can serve as a testing platform for some of the items i am mentioning below .
i would expect this is done already .
for annual accounting that seems ok , but in mtm , it seems to me that the credit analysis needs to take into consideration the credit rating transition probabilities .
it seems to me that the data used to develop the default probabilities are over different business segments and are ok ----for that range of companies .
this would be a useful mba project to examine these types of corporate variables and compare it to their credit rating forward curve .
this leads me to something i hope we can acomplish in the special finance team .
if we can combine our customers into " exposure group portfolios " ( for lack of a better term ) , where a group has similar " risk characteristics " beyind the current parameter set , that we define , then this offers a potential to shop some of these exposure to specialized insurance markets .
for most of the above points , the " improved " analysis could make the credit risk be higher .
i just spoke with lawyer burlingame and we 're on for lunch .
i think they will go to the rose bowl .
i would like to use the lexis .
i have an id number but no password , can you help me .
the online group will be sending out a packet that includes this list and all the information you 're group will need to get started .
if at all possible , i 'd like to have the appropriate names early this afternoon .
thanks again for your help , dan

supposedly they are ready to go for a project overseas with a jv between hq and probably the main utility in france .
they are ready with funds for the deposit .

storage injection space remains tight due to two tests being run on regt today and tomorrow .
arkla has been burning less than 200 mdth / d but is forecasted to increase slightly for saturday as a weak cold front moves across the area but quickly return to warmer than normal levels on sunday and into next week .
the final guidance , developed by epa 's office of wetlands , oceans and watersheds in the agency 's office of water does not differ substantially from draft guidance circulated last month . . . .
this finding , announced in a technical staff paper open for public comment , sets the agency up to enter the next phase of nonroad diesel engine regulation -- more stringent standards for these engines and their diesel fuel , says an epa official in the office of transportation and air quality . . . .

could you please together a confidentiality agreement for the following company : metron steel , a dba of primary steel ,
sorry to be so slow in getting back to you .
the competition between power generation and storage for supply will continue , and gas prices must remain high enough to discourage marginal end - use demand and allow low storage inventories to build .
although continued strong storage injections would take some pressure off the gas market , a shift to a lower pricing plane -- below $ 4.00 per mmbtu -- depends on sustained mild summer weather .
not yet enough despite recent high storage injection rates , storage inventories are not high enough to ensure that supplies will reach adequate levels for next winter .
with hot weather still likely to return , however , new york prices for august should average $ 0.32 above the henry hub .
with supply filling contracted capacity on export pipes , the inability of transcanada to discount below the minimum interruptible rate may be creating a two - tiered market .
[ agreement ] dan , this looks fine , so if you would like to have your people execute it and forward it to us , we will execute and close the loop .
it could be dangerous - i might come home a millionaire or broke " bass , jason " < jason .
but , i have entered them to assist us with managing our postion and scheduling the pipe .
that after all your discussions with business unit head and aas we are ( changing ) improving the program on the suggestions that you all wanted to see .
i think this could help everyone believe they were a part of the changes personally .
have a great week - end !
thanks amy < < ole object : picture ( device independent bitmap )
with regards to the devon ca the following are the devon comments ; you should add at the beginning of paragraph 3 , the following : " each party represents that in providing confidential information to the other , it has the right and authority to do so .
you say that the agreement concerns purchase of electricity in the carthage area , but in the opening paragraph , the ca states that it is related to " a proposed sale and/or purchase of natural gas or fuel .
for example , more definitive language would be something like " ... in connection with a proposed sale and/or purchase of electricity in the carthage field area for purpose of providing power to compression facilities .
other than that , the ca looks good .
jim , do you mind taking a quick look at this document .

sivy believes that these problems will soon pass , profit growth will pick up again , and the stock 's valuation -- well below historical levels -- will climb back toward normal .
how can you possibly like anything about mcdonald 's -- either the business or the stock ?
a proven ability in the past to build faster and a net profit margin that 's the envy of the sector .
if analysts could n't anticipate the effect of telecom infrastructure overbuilding on cisco 's business , they ca n't anticipate anything .
and the mcdonald 's marketing machine will improve its success rate .
and sooner or later , the stock 's multiple will improve .
i 'm not looking for the next dell computer , but i do think that from this price the return on mcdonald 's will beat a 12 percent hurdle rate .
as for your point about past record being more compelling , yeah , i give a company credit for a track record .
especially when things have changed to make previous advantages less impressive -- as i believe has happened to mcdonald 's .
i tend to think that the fashion has changed far more than the underlying fundamentals .
are low -- that 's true even if you ca n't predict where their next success will come from .

he 's healthy , which could be another month or longer .
some in the group thought that they were the right choice over , for example , andrews & kurth , because the issues in the the px bankruptcy would be more focused at the courthouse than at ferc .
if that happened to be greenberg firm --- great --- but they would have to interview like the rest .
i think we need to talk about this at length .
with respect to your first point , i will instruct greenberg glusker to modify the footnote regarding mccutcheon doyle to indicate that the committee " will consider supporting " an application under section 503(b ) .
while the committee has not yet considered the question , as you point out , nevertheless we anticipate that mccutcheon doyle 's assistance will be very helpful in the prosecution of the commandeering litigation .
i believe the committee would like to hear from greenberg , glusker again a description of the firm 's qualifications in this regard as well as interview other firms which may be qualified to take on the task .
if i do not receive any comments , i plan on signing the application on behalf of the committee at that time .

pat wood iii has been nominated for a position with ferc .
the combination of strong investor interest and an upswing in profits indicates that solar power could be embarking on a market boom that up to only a few years ago was seen as very unlikely .
astropower is reporting continued strong performance for the company , and in fact has stated that it has far more sales opportunities than it can supply .
however , the suddenly strong performance of both evergreen solar and active power - after previous quarters , and even decades , of financial losses - indicates that market opportunities have opened up considerably for companies involved in solar power development and marketing .
i think there are several factors driving this renewed interest .
another reason is that many homeowners and building associations across the country are not receptive to solar power , which serves as a deterrent for potential customers that may want to use the sun to power new projects .

and we would prefer to deliver the forms upon execution and thereafter upon request .

we asked that tax event and tax event upon merger be excluded as specified conditions .
i have several thoughts on this section .
the credit rating for a party should include both s&p and moody 's and a party 's ability to hold posted collateral should be based on the lower of those two .
finally , we would like the requirements of the custodian to be a rating of at least a / a2 and having total assets of at least us $ 10,000,000,000 .
the first sentence of this section should be amended accordingly .
the statement to be presented to the issuing bank should conform to the circumstances under paragraph 8 of the csa under which the secured party can demand payment and not just be limited to an event of default .
i am pleased to attach the revised isda schedule and csa which contains > most of the revisions dlj requested .

all -- here 's some thoughts on our work with the governors going forward thru the next 3 to 6 months .
although paul and i have talked about picking 4 or 5 specific issues or solutions to focus on , i am a bit concerned that we will not be able to get them to focus on more than 1 or 2 .
here 's a few strategies we 've been talking about in addition to what we 're doing at the wga transmission workshop meetings : 1 .
we would need to come up with that timeline in very short order , as the best shot we would have in getting those dates in the public domain on record would be thru the energy resolutions that will be passed at the wga annual conference in august .
however , if we could get a very simple message on this goal we might have a shot .
formalize a list of compatible items in both the democrat and the cheney / bush plans and work to communicate those areas that could be agreed on .
i 'm not sure how measurable the benefit to us would be in this endeavor
--- i think we would have to do tremendous pr in order for it to have any benefit to bush and therefore the republican governors .
the individual benefits to locke and kitzhaber might be better relationships for us with their offices , but i 'm not sure what else .
mark , i would appreciate your comments on the following faq 's , intended to be a guide for louise / myself / pr in the event we take a media call regarding the injunction / lawsuit .
also , if you have any ideas to expand the list , please let me know .
a agency.com was hired to provide development support for some elements of enrononline .
does this experience make you want to avoid working with outside agencies ?
we believe that outside agencies are a valuable source of expertise which can complement the enron 's strong it skillset .
we are very pleased with the final product represented by enrononline , but are not in a position to comment on the strength of any of the individual contributors .
we hope to prevent the further release of confidential information .

long - term a higher rate of economic growth will lead to a greater expansion in natural gas use than previously forecast over the next 20 years --- to 34.7 tcf/ year in 2020 , up from 31.5 tcf --- and a 10 % increase in projected prices --- from $ 2.81/mcf to $ 3.13 , according to the energy information administration 's latest report .
eia projects world oil prices will reach $ 22.41/barrel ( in 1999 dollars ) in 2020 , up just slightly from the $ 22.04 in last year 's forecast .
power to be provided by nuclear generation jumped 34 % from the forecast last year " due to lower estimated costs for extending the life of current nuclear plants and higher projected natural gas prices , although total nuclear generation still declines as some existing plants retire .

therefore , he has asked that we look into what it would take for us to obtain a securities dealer 's license .
i would be grateful if you could please prepare a short memo and set forth what the capital requirements , reporting requirements , monitoring , experience and education level of staff , performance bond , exact level of " surplus liquid funds " , length of time for application to be processed , ongoing obligations , etc ... would realistically be .
but i would be grateful if one of you could please condense this and give us specifics that we can present to gary .
please call me if you want to discuss .
hi stacey , i thought you would want to be at this meeting regarding setup of traders for tradetrac .
just give me a call at x36218 if you have any questions , or would prefer that someone else attend .
i will need to talk with marcus nettelton for clarification .
kay - thanks for your attention and assistance in this matter .
i also talked to several people last week in contracts and legal asking for help , but a process does not seem to be in place .
please advise as to how quickly we can act on these requests .
please advise as to what i can provide or help out with this process .
i am sure more producers will call .
he said he was sure the females in your reading audience would come up with a similar list for men .
here 's my list , which i hope you will print in the interest of fairness : ten rules for men 1 .
when you go to the store , ask if we want anything .
we think you look great , even when you lose your hair .
we can not read your mind .
if you need our help to buy a gift for your secretary or set up a dinner for your mother , please do n't ask us at the last minute .
we might feel better later , and your chances will be a lot better .
also , i need you to initial the docs where enron is signing .
i think we would show it on exxonkaty , but i ca n't find anything in path manager on exxonkaty or tejas .
" because i knew i wanted to stay in state and , after visiting a&m and texas ( unofficially ) , i just like texas better .
both say they are committed , but both want to look around a little bit to see if they find anything better .
williams probably will wind up at ou and smith probably will wind up at texas , but both cases will bear watching right up to and through signing day in february .
the horns have a pretty good shot at everyone in the top seven on that list - no . 1
that would give the longhorns four straight super classes heading into next season and , for the first time , the oldest group of that foursome would be seniors or juniors who have redshirted .
pickryl also plans to graduate early , so he also could be counted back to last year if he signs with texas .
the number will be on the low side if smith stays solid and pickryl goes alsewhere , but it will rise if smith strays and pickryl comes aboard .
the surgery probably would knock him out of most or all of the contact work , but should allow him to be fully recovered by the start of next season .
we turned the ball over and could not overcome the adversity we created for ourselves .
we knew it would n't be easy to run on colorado , but we knew we had to keep at it .
they did a great job of coming and doing exactly what we were n't planning on .
they came out ready to play on both sides of the ball , as well as on special teams .
they also did a nice job in the punt return game .
what that mean is that texas has a very good chance to land one of the four major bcs bowl spots if they take care of business and win their final four games to finish the regular season at 10 - 1 .
the top two teams in the final bcs standings will play for the national title in the rose bowl on january 3 .
texas coach mack brown and his longhorns hope to be in that game , but their chances are somewhere between very slim and none because oklahoma would have to lose twice in the regular season for that to happen and then the horns would have to beat the big 12 north winner , probably nebraska .
but , by winning out and finishing 10 - 1 , the longhorns would have a great chance to play in the sugar bowl in new orleans in the post - season .
what i 'd do when i had the chance >

misery loves company heavy load energy costs in the western u.s. rose for monday delivery on expectations of more weather - related demand at the start of the new week , as well as on the usual premium that occurs when scheduling three days out .
but next week could prove to be a bit more exciting if the cold weather materializes , " said one marketer on friday .
enron declined to say how much ubs is paying , but company lawyers said they will release details of the winning bid to a new york bankruptcy judge on monday .
heavy load energy costs in the northwest rose by as much as 2$/mwh for power to be delivered on monday , largely the result of forecasted cooling over the weekend , which was likely to boost demand early in the new week .
sunday 's inclusion usually brings light load prices up , but light load ran up more than i expected at the end , maybe on the number of units off for the weekend and the colder weather anticipated in the new week , " said one california trader .
while most regional temperatures were expected to remain above or just at normal levels into the new week , the latest six - to - ten was predicting a round of below - normal temperatures for the entire desert region from january 17 to 21 .
an upturn in the gas market , cooler temperatures for the new week , and stronger real - time prices for much of the day all helped boost peak power prices for monday delivery in the mid - atlantic on friday .
sources also thought the unit would remain down into the early part of the new week .
forecasts for monday called for temperatures to remain above normal but below friday 's readings .
the most current six - to - ten predicted below - normal conditions from january 17 to 21 .
although the high end was significantly lower , the bulk of transactions were seen near thursday 's levels .
february is hopefully near the low end of where it can trade , but the physical market is weak , so it all depends on how weather forecasts and gas do next week , " commented one forwards trader .
temperatures were expected to cool somewhat in the new week , but ample generation kept prices in check .
sorry if this causes any confusion .

lindy , would you please look this over .
i will notify this group when migration is completed and in production for the additional groups on the tw unsubscribed capacity page .
this was in conjunction with the revenue management project that kim watson headed up , but my group was also very interested in developing a more sophisticated ( hopefully ) analysis of pipeline flows , basis differentials , regional supply / demand , etc . for development of our short / long term strategies .
this model would accept a wide array of input data such as gas price curves , oil price curves , production potential of the major basins , regional market demand , pipeline tariffs , pipeline capacity limits , etc .
in theory , we could then have a more reasoned view of which pipelines would be either " winners " or " losers " , which expansions would most likely be built , and what basis would exist at all pertinent trading points .
i understand that enron already has a similar model for the electric generating / transmission grid in north america , and it has proven quite valuable .
in addition to the altos model , we also looked at a model that had been developed by icf consulting .
both companies made very impressive presentations and had obviously spent a great deal of time developing their work .
for comparison , vince has also considered whether enron should develop our own proprietary model in - house .
vince now believes that the most cost effective way to get to final working model that we have confidence in , is to start with the altos model and work with them to add / modify certain features .
i think it would be good to have another ets representative ( other than me ) and possibly someone from nbp present at the meeting .
eol approval profiles please add lisa lees to the distribution list for the eol profiles and remove frank davis .
at this point it is discretionary - we need to figure out the position we would like to take .

we met in the associate orientation last summer when you asked me if i would like to join ena for my first rotation .

i believe by doing so , i will be given the opportunity to work with the smartest people in this industry .
i also believe i am prepared to join the trading unit in ena .
only if you could give me five minutes of your precious time to allow me to prove my qualifications , i will greatly appreciate it .
and , in no way , shape or form will i settle and end up with some dush .
i think your attitude about the whole situation is extremely healthy and mature ( it amazing what happens when you care more about the other person than yourself ) .
hi karen , sorry i have n't sent the notice .
please share if it 's handy !
i 'll be in houston next week ; i 'll find you to say hi .
, here 's a potential candidate for your opening .
let me know if you 're interested in interviewing him .
obviously , we 're talking to a lot of folks from the middle east and we 're finding a lot of wonderful people , some who 've overstayed their visit .
a friend responding to a chronicle e - mail query thursday said atta has been missing since right after the sept. 11 explosions in new york and washington , and his friends were worried about him and did not believe he could have been involved .
the renewed emphasis on legal recourse would appear to be a direct fallout of the cancellation of the prime ministers planned visit to new york later this month , during which enron hoped to press its case through high level interaction between the governments of india and the us .
the government had set up a committee led by indian financial institutions to work out an exit route for the us power developer which had already decided to exit the project .
according to enrons estimates , the project incurs an additional cost of rs 500 crore every day on account of interest during construction .
the total increase in the project cost would be to the tune of about 39 per cent with a whopping financial liability of rs 15,000 crore on mseb if enron wins the case .
according to this communication international financial institutions who have a total exposure of $ 1.1 billion too now want to exit from the project , and would want their stake to be bought out .
its end will affect customers around the state , including more than 170 school districts that had pooled together to seek a new electricity provider .
current direct access customers can remain with their energy providers through the end of their contracts .
it has been told by wall street it can expect better rates if it shows it has a guaranteed and expandable incoming flow of money .
the businesses left after learning power contracts the state had cut in the spring likely would have california ratepayers paying more than if they bought power elsewhere .
the reorganised pacific gas & electric will continue to own and operate existing retail electricity and natural gas distribution systems .
the events triggered a rush for very large crude carriers ( vlccs ) with charterers booking tankers well into the future to ensure that they can move oil from the arabian gulf if there is conflict in the region .
i think rates will start to slip after this initial spike , but they 're going to take time to come down .
owners do n't want their ships delayed in a port for ages or hit by a missile " .

livehealth can present its reports via a browser - based interface , a server - based console and adobe acrobat - based reports .
livehealth can tell you if a device is performing as it 's supposed to , but it ca n't produce graphical maps showing network hierarchies .
then , it can detect out - of - the - ordinary events , such as excessively high or low traffic through a router or switch port .
livehealth polls the device in frequencies up to twice a minute to help the administrator track the situation .
we could see devices that had experienced problems , by type of problem , as well as those associated with a particular application .
the documentation is comprehensive , but should include a better roadmap to help users find the various software component discussions in the manuals .
livehealth 's installation was more difficult than we expected , but we found that livehealth 's focus on performance and its extensive reporting are just what the doctor ordered .

tracy and james , elaine and phil thought it would be nice to include this summary page in the plan review package for stan 's review next week .

hi vince , i ( and possibly stinson as well ) will be attending this initial meeting looks like kick - off type of meeting .
i will try to attend to drill into what they can offer and what we have committed .
i 'll fire off additional information as i get them .
i 've attempted to define exactly what problem we could consider getting an ietf working group started on .
my summary of the existing ietf wgs with interests in metrics is given below ( appendix b ) , but it seems unlikely that we could get a new ietf wg started .
i believe that we should instead run a single caida working group on ' network metrics , ' rather than the two proposed earlier .
it focuses on producing educational material about network measurement , and on developing new metrics - these were the two areas of greatest interest amongst the caida members .
work through revised charter in detail - identify the work required for each part - determine who 's willing to work on it
- summary of metrics used for current services - gather information / ideas about new / emerging services , especially diffserv - based ones - make list of new metrics , either to improve measurement of existing services or to support new ones [ list of ' metrics ' questions ( appendix a ) goes here ]
+ organise experimental implementation / testing of tools for new metrics + make recommendations on implementation - define core set of ' really useful ' metrics - recommend that caida implement these as a ' service measurement toolkit ' + publish new metric definitions through ippm or rtfm + produce document " measurement requirements for hardware / software vendors .
will these new differentiated transport- and application - layer services need new metrics ?
its primary goal was to produce an improved traffic flow measurement model considering at least the following needs :
these metrics will be designed such that they can be performed by network operators , end users , or independent testing groups .
we will buy it at $ 3.22 please call mike cahill tomorrow at 908 - 719 - 4271 for comfirmation .
the wire information for midamerican - the total that we need to send them for a / r and oba is $ 1,762,907.66 which will need to go out on 12/26/2001 .

since the $ 12 k pertains to the same investment as the $ 8.2mm , i knew that we would have to send it to the same account .
but maybe we should check with danny because he is familiar with the transaction .
conservation is strongly urged today and could easily make the difference in maintaining operating reserves at a level that could lesson or prevent blackouts .
in section 3 on page 3 we state that tw intends to contract for long - term capacity vs. short - term capacity and therefore we will have a higher priority and will not be the " lowest priority on pnm " .

i think we have a shot and feel much better about our chances than i did upon initially reviewing the trustee 's brief .
i hope you are talking to phillip to get you system needs as part of this project .
i just wanted to keep you in the loop .
any assistance that you can offer is greatly appreciated .
issues & to do list phillip , below is the issues & to do list as we go forward with documenting the requirements for consolidated physical / financial positions and transport trade capture .
what we need to focus on is the first bullet in allan 's list ; the need for a single set of requirements .
although the meeting with keith , on wednesday , was informative the solution of creating a infinitely dynamic consolidated position screen , will be extremely difficult and time consuming .
what needs to happen on monday from 3 - 5 is a effort to design a desired layout for the consolidated position screen , this is critical .
this does not exclude building a capability to create a more flexible position presentation for the future , but in order to create a plan that can be measured we need firm requirements .
the other issues that have been raised will be capture as projects on to themselves , and will need to be prioritised as efforts outside of this project .
i believe there has been good communication between the teams , but now we need to have focus on the objectives we set out to solve .
we really need a single point of contact to help drive the trader requirements and help come to a consensus regarding the requirements .
we 're getting hit with a lot of different requests , many of which appear to be outside the scope of position consolidation .
things left to do : i think it may be useful to try to formulate a high level project goal to make it as clear as possible what we 're trying to accomplish with this project .
it 'll help determine which requests fall under the project scope .
go through the list of requests to determine which are in scope for this project and which fall out of scope .
for those in scope , work to define relative importance ( priority ) of each and work with traders to define the exact requirements of each .

i think when the dust settles in february the longhorns will have another great class signed and ready for delivery .
several of them this june could be from big defensive linemen , and that 's where the longhorns need to load up this season .
anderson , like keller dt tully janszen , is a super quick starter who could play end or tackle in college .
the coaches also want a super quick de , and their best hope in texas might be nick owino of alief elsik .
blanton is an outstanding running back , but he probably will be a wide receiver or defensive back in college .
both will be top national recruits next year .
there are some very good wide receivers in texas this year , but the best one i have seen on tape is marquis johnson of champaign ,
ill. if he played in texas , he would be high in my top 25 and would be easily the no . 1 wide receiver .
i plan to see him play in early september and might move him up on the list after that .
the winner of the ut - a&m game will play the winner of a game between no . 2

under the terms of the agreement , tnpc will market wind power supplied by community energy from a site under development in the mountains of northeast pennsylvania .
this is an interesting development , especially considering that tnpc is still embroiled in a battle with green mountain for a significant number of customers that tnpc recently secured in a bidding process from peco energy .
tnpc customers will be able to buy wind energy in fixed kilowatt - hours , allowing for more customized service and tailored use of power .
tnpc reiterates that it is a new company with a very limited operating history .
tnpc issued its ipo on oct. 5 , 2000 , at a price of $ 21 per share , which at the time seemed quite high for a start - up energy company with a limited track record .
first , it needs to acquire additional customers to expand its base .
key states such as texas or ohio offer the best opportunity to secure customers since competition is unfolding at a more rapid pace in those states .
regarding the customer base expansion , ohio looks like the next state that tnpc will target .
mark , thanks for looking at the language .
let me know if you need further explaination .
before i can do anything , i need the enron company number for egp fuels .

please provide the following information to be included with these financials .
( i would think that the books of egp should show the actual charges .
the best we can do here is to work with the actuary to do an estimate of the costs but this will likely require a historical pull of information which you may or may not have available .

there is no way i can look at this until later this week .
any guidance you can provide is greatly appreciated .
any suggestions on where i should go for this information ?

perry - bp wants to know what capacity exists at these points through october .
could you please followup with may - oct and let michelle know tomorrow .
hi perry - could you please check to see how much capacity is currently available through wt-2 and at each of the following delivery points :
the bet came as aes 's shares were tumbling , and , depending on when it was closed out , could have netted him a profit of more than $ 15 million .
in short sales , investors borrow shares of a stock and sell them , hoping the stock will fall so they can replace the shares with cheaper ones .
such trades are riskier than buying a company 's shares directly , because if the stock rises strongly , an investor with a short position on the shares can be forced to " cover " the bet at a sky - high cost .
based on information in the article and his general knowledge about how business in brazil worked , he felt that the company 's stock might fall in price .
he adds that there would be no obvious way for mr. skilling to have gained any unique or valuable knowledge about aes through enron 's dealings with his company .
just accounting for the 600,000 shares he owns outright , the collar proposed by schwab could have saved mr. skilling more than $ 30 million .
interestingly , professional investors often will try to hedge a big positive bet on a company in any given industry by shorting shares of a rival , on the theory that if the entire industry tumbles , the gains on the short sale would offset the losses on the long position .
in the future if you see errors or discrepancies in deals done by the short term west hourly desk , please send the e - mail to bill and myself .
this will hopefully be a more direct way of nipping the problem in the bud .

i wanted to bring both of these jobs to your attention given the staffing questions that we had today .
i wish i could send you the internal pictures of all the construction , they are incredible .
but i thought i heard jeff say " let me know if there is anything i can do to help " get those invoices out .
and i would interpret that to mean " i welcome the opportunity to learn more about the ces sales / purchase contract and would be overjoyed at pricing the 30 plus 1st of the month pricing scenarios .
to update our files , we would also appreciate receiving a copy of your most recent list of authorized power marketing contacts .
although most of you have not seen this document as a whole in a while , your input to various sections has been very helpful and i appreciate it .

fact sheets on enron assets in sa jena : i look forward to receiving more details on the storyline that you will be developing .
meanwhile , i work on identifying who you should interview in enron to provide you with the information you are seeking .
, here 's some thoughts we have on the story .
of course , like enron , we 're willing to be flexible , depending on what we find out .
since it began in 1985 , enron has always been in the vanguard of u.s. companies getting into new markets overseas , from india , where the company made the largest single private investment in the country 's history , to japan where the company recently announced it will build its first power plant .
this will focus more on south america than the rest of the world .
i 'll look at the transition from working on pipeline projects in south america to the more service - oriented business in argentina .
i 'll also look at the pipeline and the creation of this natural gas market in south america .
i know this is pretty vague , but i expect to do more research in the coming weeks and have it more ironed out .
james - know michele has come to you with financial # crunching requests & she would have this time as well ,
frank makes it a pleasure to come to work knowing that he will always be there with a wonderful attitude and a smile .
he is always excited to see and find new ways to implement the latest inventions in a way to help with productivity .
lewis has set up several " brown bag " training sessions to help employees learn about and communicate knowledge about the software used .
steve drives the whole team to consistent , timely and quality work , while always looking for a better way to accomplish a task .
i 'll be picking steve up at the hotel and 9:30 am tomorrow morning .
and thank you very much for paging him for me .
i 'm glad everything worked out for you .
hope you have a great time !

please feel free to respond via e - mail or call me at home at 415 - 285 - 7385 .
i have asked mark taylor to see if the ercot team could speak with bryan murtaugh at 1 pm thursday ( in 38c2 ) .
we will know , hopefully , by mid morning tomorrow .
i 'll send another note with the final plans .
dear jeff ; we just saw the great news------ congratulations .
based upon hoyt 's email below , there may be a desire to have a more expeditious process .
i would suppose the answer would depend on how heavily our legal department is going to be involved in gsp work .
lawyer approval michelle , we talked about this at david 's staff meeting last week and he seemed to want to develop a quicker process on approval when a lawyer such as ann murray or pat mccarthy was involved .
i would love to visit with you about a rotation .
no , i was waiting for you to tell me if cutter agreed to the revisions , and i needed to discuss revisions w/ jeff hodge for approval .
i would recommend that you use two different post id 's to do this .
would you please respond with this info .
thank you , becky elmore enron corp. benefits
iso mechelle , sorry for the delay on getting you the documents in question .

your review and approval of the following one of two product type in the eol datamanager is urgently needed ( for directions on approval , please see steps for approval at the bottom of this e - mail ) .
i will try to call all of you later today or tomorrow morning to discuss .
this has been a very difficult decision .
fyi ; let me know if you have any thoughts about my approach below .
i met with jeff golden earlier today and he suggested that such a " matrix " was being prepared and should be ready for distribution early next week .
i will push hard to make sure this gets put together .
i tried to implement this for two years , but i could n't get anyone in the legal department to take it on , nor could i get buy - in from the satellite corporate development groups .
i sincerely hope you are successful , although it may fall into the category of too little , too late ....
some of what follows may be old news or otherwise outdated , but as i try to get up the learning curve
, i thought it may be helpful to summarize some items that i would think could be extremely helpful in the organization of our commercial and legal actions .
if any of you can advise me whether we already have these items in place or , if not , your suggestions in this regard , i would very much appreciate it .
per an earlier conveersation with dave , ee were n't quite sure if you have seen a listing yet of all of the products we offer online , so i am sending you one of our excel spreadsheets which has at the top of it all of the products we offer , as well as the enron entity that a counterparty would enter into the trade with .
i would love for him to participate .
since it would be at enron , i ca n't see any problem .
if you were out of town , i could take him home or work it out with neil .
anyway , if paige is accepted , i would be happy to be backup .
kidventure camp hi charlotte , we are starting to check out our options for the summer , and one of the things we are considering is the day camp that enron is involved with .
they pick up and deliver from the enron building , and i was wondering if you might consider picking michael up from here ( enron ) .
i have no idea if this is the direction we will go , but i thought i would run it by you early on .
i have to think about how much travel i might have , as it might be hard on neil to take michael downtown in the morning .
paige has applied for a job at enron , though , so if that worked out we would be in good shape .
i 'm going to be in new york covering the wef from january 31st ' to february 1st '
and i would be obliged if you will be able to give us a short interview during the days of the convention .
i hope that you will be able to grant me the interview , and thank you in advance for your kind consideration .
christmas would have to be a high - alert day -- a day on which a bomb or a hijacking would have especially great news value , and on which both security and in - flight personnel were likely severely understaffed .
[ but ] i 'm suspicious about imposing something one would hope that school districts would voluntarily want .
rip it has n't been a good year for bill clinton .
please let me know if you have additional changes .
i 'll call you when i hear more from him .
and i hope you had a safe flight home .
i 'll get a feel of the level we need / want we can spend etc ....

sorry in getting back with you soooooo late , but it 's been crazy around here ! ! ! ! !
thanks to all of you who responded .

they have a draft decision from the cpuc changing the distribution rate components associated with these rate schedules , thus closing the loop hole .
login and password will be rbadeer_pc .

would you guys send me a new contract when you get a chance please ?
i 've already sold gas to another party for may
i was hoping that you could either forward this message to mr. philippe bibi or email me his contact information
since i have not heard of any corrections , i can send them to you asap .
however , these include only those i have been working on and does not include bryce 's entries or any other additions beyond what we added in our meeting .
any idea on when you 'll have the spreadsheets up to date .
i 'd like to get them in the new lotus notes
if you can give them to me both spreadsheets after you 're done , i 'll work with dave magee to get them in the db .
let me know if i need to help .
let me know if you want to stay in the loop on this at the development stage .

as the office construction process continues , your offices will be among the next to be demolished & reconstructed .

therefore , i have provided numbers below where i can be reached .
thanks to each of you for your dedication .
i hope each of you have a wonderful and safe holiday !
i 've chartered in the bvi a number of times and it is a great place to take beginners .
i 'm assuming you 're picking up the boat in road town or nearby .
as for first day - if you are away by 1 i suggest heading over to the bight on norman island .
it should n't take more than a few hours to get there and if it looks like it might be close you can always fire up the engine .
my advice running roughly clockwise : skip soppers hole - just a commercial port with little of interest ( unless you 're clearing customs ) ; skip the usvi - all the clearing out & in & out & in can take a lot of time
sometimes it seems like the distances are so short you do n't get to sail enough - you should n't have any trouble getting a lot in ( but you wo n't be able to see everything ) .
the only difficulty might be if you need to get the boat back in for an early flight
having said that , i suggest cooper island or the bight for your last night - it just makes that last morning a bit more leisurely .
ask at your chart briefing for the best spots these days .
the cruising guide will have lots of info on all these issues .
sorry so late , but does 4 pm california time work for you ?
whilst taking a curve other than the day end curve is relatively easy to do ( once we have agreed a formal procedure and changed the it feeds ) and would give us only minor p&l concerns on a daily basis there is an impact on determining and hedging our usd cashflows .
shane is going to put a note together to outline the issues and have a stab at attaching a monetary cost ( although i expect he will have to guesstimate the amounts ) .
depending on the size this will need to be communicated to the business heads here in london .
ok - we 'll get on the crude oil list right away - and i 'll touch base with john nowlan .
if you need anything else , please let us know .
members of the program regularly tell us that senior level interaction is an area that we can improve on , so your participation in events like this very important .
as always , we appreciate your continued support of the program .
all shippers affected by any necessary capacity allocation will be notified as soon as possible .
i am setting up an internal meeting / conference call for early next week to discuss the message we want to make at ferc , and to air any sensitivities that these ferc meetings may entail .
i think that we can provide ferc staff with an opportunity to better understand the gas market , and how enron trades to support its sales .
after agreement on our strategy and how to go forward , i will call and set up meetings with the appropriate folks at ferc .
with respect to your specific suggestion below , we are fine with this approach if it follows the discussion suggested here .
i would recommend the following -- 1 .
i will meet you at mi luna at 7 .
whatever kind of look you were going for , you missed " >
please let us know if you would like to talk prior to tomorrow 's meeting with credit .
please make sure you read so that you become familiar with the new standby procurement penalty rules for the g - imb tariff .
please call me if you have questions regarding this new g - imb calculation .
needless to say , it may be difficult under the antitrust type analysis for enron to claim harm when eol boast of being the " world 's largest website for global commodity transactions .
fyi -- just in case you did n't get a copy of the announcement , below is the article from inside ferc with the details of the filing at ferc of the previously announced expansion project to be completed and in - service by may , 2003 .
the 2003 expansion would bring supplies to a region of the country that " has experienced well - documented , severe energy shortages , " kern river said .
kern river also plans to build a new meter station under its existing certificate to interconnect kern river / mojave facilities with the 30-inch - diameter adelanto lateral proposed by
by far the biggest customer for the capacity would be reliant energy services inc. , which signed a 15- year agreement for 200,000 dt / day .
in addition , the 2003 expansion shippers would be responsible for paying a fuel in - kind reimbursement factor of 3.05 % for volumes transported from wyoming to california ; the rates would be lower for shorter trips .
as for supply , given the large volume of remaining reserves and the amount of drilling activity in the rocky mountain region , production could increase by more than 1.5 bcf / day over the next year and by 4.5 bcf / day over the next five years , according to a report prepared for kern river by barlow and
if it merges with enron , another favorite davis target , dynegy would be a powerhouse in energy trading , electricity generation and natural gas transmission .
the report also found that dynegy reaped about $ 32 million in " monopoly rents " between may and november of last year , or profits beyond what a competitive market would bear .
that was the fourth - highest total for any company noted in the report .
while this administration has been quite tolerant of mergers ... an action by the california attorney general could have a significant chance of success , " rasmussen said .
also i was wondering if there was something i could personally such as going to ny in person to aid in the physical recovery process or lend my logistical professional expertise to help organize things .
i just feel like i need to do something significantly more that the money donation though i know that within itself is very important ?
a healthy combination of shallow cold air in the north and record warmth in the south will help spin up a sizeable storm in the southern plains later today that will turn to the ne .
more can be expected through the great lakes and new england later in the week .

terry glenn wr ne - matty updated 11/30/01 glenn , who has been suspended for sunday 's game against the jets , may have played his last game for new england .
he 's still been a huge disappointment overall , and is n't worth starting in most fantasy leagues .
he could find it tough to be productive against pittsburgh 's top - ranked defense , but he 's still worth starting based on his potential to put up solid fantasy numbers .
he 's has n't been playing up to his high standards this season , but it 's almost impossible to bench him based on his potential to post solid fantasy numbers .
stl - frank updated 11/29/01 bruce may not be having his best statistical season , but he 's still worth starting on a weekly basis .
if you have a better tight end on your roster , you may want to consider benching conwell in week 12 .
updated 11/29/01 huntley 's numbers have improved a bit over the last two weeks , but he 's still far too unreliable to start on a weekly basis .
he may not be as reliable as he 's been in the past , but walls is still worth starting on a weekly basis , especially in deeper leagues .

that is how much the operators of brazil 's electricity grid say needs to fall to ensure that hydroelectric plants will continue to run at full capacity , averting the need for energy rationing , like the recent rolling blackouts in california , in at least part of brazil later in the year .
a lot of companies have been calling us in the last two weeks to see if it is possible to invest in this type of project , ' ' said nelson cardoso de oliveira , business development manager for energyworks , a unit of the electric utility iberdrola s.a. of spain .
the volumes that we are dealing with do n't provide a complete solution for the country , but they can certainly resolve localized problems , ' ' said ivan marimon , the sales manager at guascor do brasil , a joint venture controlled by grupo guascor of spain , which builds small - scale power plants for hospitals .
and the cost , at about $ 6 million for a small 5-megawatt plant , could be just as cost effective for some companies as buying electricity from the national grid , especially since electricity prices were expected to increase significantly in the next several years .
but for a project to be viable for financiers and builders , companies need to agree to buy the electricity for 15 to 20 years .
brazilian companies and some overseas concerns are searching for more energy sources to make sure their electricity needs will be met .
the atlanta - based company said it has n't decided how large the facility will be , but " some limited operations " are expected to begin by year 's end .
honda motor plans to begin producing motorcycles in asia outside japan within two years for sale in japan , its president said .

-- l'oreal 's chairman said he is confident the french cosmetics maker can maintain sales growth this year , after the company reported first - quarter sales rose 12.7 % from a year earlier to 3.4 billion euros ( $ 3.07 billion ) .
brazil posts unexpected rise in output brazil 's industrial production in february rose by a surprising 1.5 % from a year earlier , even though the month had three fewer working days than in 2000 because the nationwide carnival festivities fell in february this year instead of march .
mr. chavez could conceivably remain in power until 2013 because the new constitution allows for re - election to a new term .
world reporter ( tm ) enron broadband services has eliminated up to 250 positions in recent weeks , a reflection of changes in the high - tech market and a consolidation of operations in the company .
enron broadband services has attracted a lot of attention in the past year for pioneering a previously unheard of notion -- treating access to the biggest internet data lines as a fluid commodity that could be bought and sold .
sycamore also said it has faced problems from an unnamed supplier in getting enough components to ship expected volumes of its high - end sn 16000 optical switching device this quarter , but hopes to have it worked out by may or june .
sycamore chief financial officer frances m. jewels said the company will not generate net cash from operations " for the next several quarters , " but is in a fair position to ride out the slowdown .
smith said sycamore is getting " positive feedback " from trials at big - name u.s. and foreign carriers of that ilk , but gave no indication any sales deals are imminent .
- transport sector end - use is unlikely to provide a substantial boost to base metal demand in the coming year , ubs warburg / enron metals said in their lme weekly metal report on friday .
depending on the metal , end - use by the transport sector makes up a large proportion of overall demand for most of the base metals complex .
north america , japan and western europe account for around 70 percent of world auto production , although developing economies are begining to play an important role .
while we expect a deterioration of sales performance in coming months .
but car sales for the first two months of the year in germany , which accounts for around a quarter of the european market , are down five percent year - on - year .
so although car sales have been better than expected in such markets as the u.s , there is still concern the transport sector may not substantially boost base metal demand over the coming year .

i have asked bradford to speak with you regarding use of it for major trading counterparties that may not be investment grade , but with whom credit sees the ability to greatly enhance our liquidity via netting of margin requirements ( not the small accounts ) .
from a cash perspective , i would think enron as whole would get more benefit from master netting ( dollar for dollar benefit ) than loan security ( which would never be a dollar for dollar benefit)--do you think this is a correct analysis ?
kay , i 'm interested to hear how things went at the meeting .

maryland is beautiful and the weather is great ... nice and cool ... in the 60/70 's !
i would simply ask vince 's team to take a quick look tommorow at valuing the ships as stand alone positions with a guess at the volatility based on historical price movements .
this would be much easier than the rainbow option approach and would allow us to roughly look at the value of the options on the other two ships .
in other words we could look at two ship long positions with some implied volatilities and also estimate daily vars on the ships as if they were mark to market ( although i agree with david that we will not likely be able to mark the ships because they will be treated as leases ) .
i would ideally like to spend the time to analyse this purchase as we do power and gas positions .
here is how we would make the decision : 1 ) our shipping expert confirms that $ 140 million for a 135,000 ton ship represents a good price relative to new build costs over the last three years and that quotes have been trending up past that number recently .
his experience and historic analysis has suggested that the pricing cycle for lng ships lasts for a significant period .
he estimates the ship could be sold in a distressed sale for $ 110 million and could be potentially time chartered on a long term basis at a value of up to $ 200 million .
the plant 's time line and the realities of the lng supply market may require that we commit to gas natural before any source of 3 to 5 year gas can be secured .
going forward , however , other potential plant opportunities in spain , and elsewhere in the med region , may have the capacity to utilise these vessels .
sorry , some reason i was thinking i was waiting on you .
would you please fax the meter statements from gepl for february so that i can try to determine which meters are flowing over what is nominated and verify that we have deals in the system for each offsystem meter .

should you require any further information , please do not hesitate to contact me .
with congressional probes , security guards posted at enron&#39;s headquarters and the recent sacking of an andersen partner , it looks like the story&#39;s still got a way to play out .
after focusing the last few editions on the developments surrounding deregulation and energy trading in both the us and europe , we&#39;re taking a closer look at two other issues of interest to the energy community - emissions and weather .

although there is still much dissension among the ranks of scientists and environmentalists as to the impact ghg has on the environment , there can be little doubt the earth&#39;s climate is predicted to change because human activities are altering the chemical composition of the atmosphere through the buildup of greenhouse gases ?

here is an update plus my thoughts on what we should consider this week .
i hope to be able to discuss this on monday 's call .
to lenders : lenders want to know we are serious about finding solutions .
other meetings can be scheduled as well , and we will want to include some add'l meetings in delhi and mumbai .
my earlier e - mail on renegotiation possibilities might provide some ideas here . ]
i lenders should realize we have done everything we can and give us the transfer notice approval .
the quicker we bring in ken and rebecca , the quicker we should have the strongest argument for the transfer notice approval .
but we will need some advance time to set up these high level meetings as well as get indian approvals to bring ken 's plane into india .
this will take about a full business week , so i think we should schedule this trip as soon as we can -- perhaps during week of may 21 .
at same time as senior management comes in , have senior contacts from wash. dc contact political leaders in delhi to request a solution be found quickly to avoid any implications on improving india / us relations e. finally , i also think it is time for enron to strongly consider an approach directly to some possible buyers .
there are also some international majors that would be possible .
depending on the appropriate enron internal approvals , 2 other assets could be considered offshore oil & gas assets data center
on the last 2 items , i know that one of the indian corporates would be interested in the oil & gas assets , and both would be interested in the data center .
we can discuss these thoughts on monday .
included is the draft work plan - please review the work plan and convey any comments to jean and copy me .

concerning growth , you might want to look at
concerning measurement of " the new economy , " a fellow student recommends the economist article at will all the pretty pics and graphs , or the plain text version below .
but measuring the size of the " new " economy is a statistical minefield .
this would make it bigger than the car industry , but smaller than health care or finance .
a third may simply be that it is still too small to make a difference : for the moment , appropriately enough , you can count the digital economy on the fingers of one hand .
hype is hype - but the new economy may yet happen anyway .

the financial express , 07/26/01 uk : analysis - more work needed for europe gas market opening .
however , the companies doing the buying might surprise you .
analysis - more work needed for europe gas market opening .
having healthy utilities is extremely important , says the governor .
as we expand the product list , we will have to note this .
as dan suggested in the message below , the cou we negotiated with malaysia lng tiga and malaysia international shipping company in connection with the metgas lng spa for the india gas pipeline project would probably be a good starting point for the cou to be used at dabhol .
however it will need to be coordinated with the other project documents and the dpc / gsc c / p for lakshmi and ultimately agreed by the p&i insurers for lakshmi .
alternately we could request that olng use for the lakshmi , the same cou as we ( enron ) have negotiated for the spot cargoes .
philip weems of king & spalding ( outside legal assistance ) worked on both the metgas and the enron spot cargo documents as he has very valuable experience on these issues .
dan has recommended that dpc use philip but with the current situation , you may not want to get into additional legal fees or even start an exercise that may be totally in vain .
please advise of your thoughts on the above .
i will phone you early tomorrow morning , houston time .
dabhol india conditions of use attached please find a copy of the cou we negotiated with malaysia lng tiga and malaysia international shipping company in connection with the metgas lng spa for the india gas pipeline project .
the state may be at risk of creating a major government - subsidized industry -- an industry that private suppliers could be at a disadvantage in competing against , " the report says .
a spokesman for gov. gray davis could not be reached for comment on the report .
i 'll let you know what is going on
regulations often create business opportunities ( as kyoto would have for enron ) or act as a barrier to entry for potential competitors ( since a big established company is more easily able to absorb the costs of regulation than a small upstart ) .
i wish everyone would forget us . "
back to normal -- iii at the new york times ( links require registration ) , they 're definitely getting back to normal .

resume hey joe , i wanted to follow up with ya ...
of course , they probably will try to talk him into walking on first , but they 'll probably come up with a scholarship if they find a great one .
the effort and intensity they showed tonight was what we were looking for .
we certainly ran the ball well and got some great looks , but did n't finish our plays on the offensive end , and that 's a concern .

leadership in both houses should stay the same , although there will be 36 new members in the two houses , thanks to term limits .

it was an honor to work with you .
i also believe the proposed gas procurement structure provides some option value to the larger qfs .
although it looks like our language will be in the gas agreement , i think we need to get some language in the bill itself .
i am working with sandi and mike day to make that happen .
we may also want to add the concept of economic dispatch to the bill .
finally , i suggest we try and set up individual meetings with the utilities ( including sce ) to discuss our ideas further .

ed gottlieb is supposed to be having someone pull the ena deals that are to be included with project triple lutz so that a determination can be made of whether someone is to contact those parties for permission to include copies in the data room , possible assignment to a dummy company which can be included in project triple lutz , or treated as the entex deals by creating a back to back between hpl supply co and ena .
i am sure everything can be worked out .
there will be one new scripted section , but that should be from the actors , and it should not be significant .
i prefer that approach , if we can do it that way .
i will contact you next week to start working on the computer based programs .
we shall make the additions you noted below . ?
we will need to make some time available during late may for practice panels ( assuming we are granted panel hearings ) and individual practice cross - examination . ?
there should be a chapter on the retail settlement with the key parties listed . ?
tom beach and vernon should be added to the chapter on impact on electric generators . ?

some pipeline tariffs do refer to open season for capacity release , but it may cause confusion so probably to remove it .
first , in both the description and the original gtc we refer to an open season ; however , this product is for capacity release , which would not be subject to an open season -- only bidding .
regarding the gtc , since we were planning on eliminating paragraph 3 anyway , which had the open season reference , i think that one is already taken care of .

jeff , i wanted to call attention to one of the new pg&e rate schedules ( g - cfs ) which randy litteneker distributed on friday evening .
while the typical storage year remains in effect , the charges would start in mid storage season when operational and economic decisions have already been completed .
i apologize for continuing to harp on this issue but as stated in proposed g - cfs , i would incur charges of $ 506,700 ( this is different from the $ 420,000 i mentioned on the phone because i neglected to include the capacity we will receive from the pg&e eneryg services acquisition .
please call me to discuss when you have a chance .
they request us to make suggested changes directly on the text with comments and explanations shown in the margins .
they need this to help them draft the thrid party access provisions for the new oil and gas law on which comments are due shortly .

we should also have a checkout process for the opinions .

, we wanted to make sure you were aware that the cpuc approved an alternate decision from loretta lynch today that limits the ability of edison ( clec light ) to use leased facilities from other providers as an alternative to getting ceqa approval and building its own facilities .
upon initial review , it does n't appear that the ruling would preclude the arrangement we discussed , in which enron would purchase service ( which could be dark fiber ) from a carrier with ceqa authority even though provision of the service would require building new facilities .
i 'd like to wait until i see the final version of the decision before giving you a more definite interpretation , but i wanted to make sure you were aware of this development until then .
please call if you have any immediate questions .

at closing net proceeds from the issuance will temporarily be invested in two short - term enron corp. ( enron ) notes .
ultimately the proceeds from the repayment of the enron notes will be used to redeem the outstanding $ 830 million 7.09 % senior secured notes due 2001 of marlin water trust ( marlin ) and pay interest on the senior notes and yield on the marlin trust certificates .
through a series of transactions , enron contributed its ownership interest in azurix to atlantic water trust ( awt ) in exchange for a 50 % ownership interest in awt .
if an amount sufficient to repay the notes has not been deposited with the trustee 120 days prior to the maturity date or upon a note trigger event , the indenture trustee will direct the share trust to sell the enron preferred stock on terms that are designed to generate an amount sufficient to redeem the notes in full .

the structure for the financial prepay does n't seem to work under the brazilian regulation therefore we need to come up with a different structure .
we ( gustavo and i ) had lunch last thursday with a mr. jose lavia owner of fair corretora ( a brokerage house that i 've worked with ) basically he thinks that the financial prepay structure is not going to work because the central bank wants to see benefits for the country and impacts in the country 's current balance .
he asked us to send him a draft of the structure and he will discuss with his partners to see if they came up with different ideas .
as recommended by antonio felix from tozzini freire , we need to decide if this is a deal / structure we want to continue to pursue .
if so we should schedule a meeting with the international operations director of the central bank in brasilia and make a presentation covering the following points : - the overall structure - market need - benefits to the companies involved ( petrochemical , pulp and paper ) - benefits to brazil ?
( if any ) we should approach this not as a single transaction but as a new product , with specific characteristics , without any similar in the market , that enron developed in the us and is trying to " sell " in brazil .
if we want we can have a brokerage house or bank in the middle to register the contract with the bm&f ( mercantile exchange ) .
a specialist form tozzini should be sending us some paper covering swap contracts .
i hope to have a better understanding of the requirements for swap contracts after we receive that .
if you have anything about that ( presentation , regulation ) would you please forward to us .
fyi and please forward as needed .
bill , many thanks for the invitation to speak at the the conference outlined below .
i do appreciate the offer , though .

i hope all is going well and congratulations on your formal recognition as ceo ..

dick know if jeff would be interested in speaking with dick further .

in the upcoming weeks we need to transfer the preparation of these reports from rac to risk operations .

in the next couple days , i will be sending you each a listing of reports prepared , and then set up a time to meet with you so we can determine the best way to go forward .
hi mr. reed - i left a message on thursday evening for rosemarie , but was out friday , so was too busy to follow up today , but having said all that , ken lay wanted me to let you know that he would like to have the tfa board meeting at the enron building .
please let me know if that will be possible .
we thank jack clark , our general counsel , for his arduous pro - bono legal work over the past 15 months that helped make this happen .
we will thank smartforce during the luncheon for their enormous gift which has a retail value that could be as high as nine figures ( depending on the number of courses utilized ) .
have you made any progress on your update ?
i still believe this has a lot of merit and would like to hear your perspective .
you then asked for a copy of it , thinking that enron could use some background on the opportunity in air logistics .
if you do n't mind , rather than send you a year old plan for a business that did n't get off the ground , i suggest that i work ( on my own time ) on a document that will speak better to enron 's needs , presenting the air logistics industry background and mapping it to potential opportunities that utilize enron 's core strengths .
i hope to have this doc done and delivered to you by the end of next week .

hi , kelly , yes , i probably am the person to contact on this .
look for it in the next few days !
it occurred to me as i sent the message below to michael brown that you may be the lawyer i need to coordinate with .
sharon butcher and i are working on a project for enron corp. hr that requires research on data protection laws in the various countries in which enron has employees .
it is likely that we will subscribe to clifford chance 's nextlaw service , a database of data protection legislation in various countries .
at the end of my message to christopher , please see the list of countries that we need information about .
if so , i would propose to christopher that if ( as i anticipate ) enron corp. subscribes to nextlaw for the project
sharon and i are working on , enron europe should be entitled to access and use the information for the other project christopher references .
please tell me which lawyer in your group i should include in discussions .
kelly very good to hear from you after all this time .
enron 's subscription to nextlaw has indeed expired , though we are starting to do some data protection work with enron europe and were planning to show them nextlaw soon as we believe it would be very useful to them .
in the meantime , i would be pleased to talk with you and sharon on monday at 09.00 houston time about how we might assist you with your new project .
i am copying this to my colleague ben ebdon in our clifford chance online group in the hope that he will be able to join us on the call on monday .
in the meantime , i hope you have a good weekend .
enron 's annual subscription lasped several months ago , but we are in need of similar services again for a different hr project .
enron senior management has tasked the hr department with the creation of an internal " expert directory " with which all enron employees can identify other enron employees who have specific skills ( such as language capabilities , experience with particular kinds of projects , political contacts , etc . ) that may be useful for new intiatives .
as you can imagine , the data that must be collected from all enron employees worldwide is significantly more complex than the information we were gathering from international employees when we engaged your firm previously .
we would now like legal advice about what consents must be obtained from employees in various foreign jurisdictions in order to collect and publish the information , whether certain information gathered must be requested on a voluntary basis ( and conversely , what information we can require that employees provide ) , etc .
i am hopeful that in the time since we last spoke , your firm has added additional jurisdictions to the subscription service , since many of the countries in which we have employees were not on the database in early 1999 .
i am also wondering whether the information included in the database is sufficient for this more complicated project .
my colleague , sharon butcher , and i would like to discuss our new project with you to see if clifford chance is again willing and able to provide the local research that we require , and to get an estimate of the cost involved .
we were hoping to call you at 9:00 am houston time on monday , may 22nd .
i hope you are well , and look forward to our work together .
on 3/23/02 , helen called the on - call for tescott concerning a hi gas detection alarm she 'd received at the station .
parts for this unit may not be available until next monday which , in turn , means unit 5 will be unavailable until then .
gary confered with kim on this and relayed to us that if any compression is needed on the high side unit 3 is ready and can be switched over for us at any time .
please help me think this out carefully.----cgy ----------------------

i thought i would share with you my ideas in regard to my upcoming trip to london .
i would like to meet with you and james new for about an hour when i first arrive to get a feel of your businesses and to give both of you an update on the new and improved global rates group .
i would also appreciate it if i could unobtrusively sit with several of your risk groups in order to among other things , get an idea of the types of commodities london trades and their respective exchanges and to become familiar with the current process that london uses to capture commodity rates .
after a couple of days , i am confident that i could have an idea of how global rates could be of the most benefit to london .
i would n't want this to interfere in anyway with your ongoing business , therefore would you please let me know when you and james would be in london during the next couple of weeks

pollution control tax credits sb 764 is up today at 4:00 pm for a hearing , so far it looks like we will be fine if the gov. 's office agrees to the latest deal .
we are working closely with the other parties on pctc vote counts and individual lobbying but when the deal is being cut if pge shows up there is the possibility that the t word could tube a deal or attract some anti t followers - so we have been very careful and low key on this issue .
we can probably start moving down the first weekend in october .

a short time ago , we introduced a new hiring process utilizing the position request form .

however , please bear in mind that the forms contain salary information and we need to ensure that they remain secure .
i will forward all requests to rob milnthorp for approval .
i think paul has a number of good suggestions here .
i also feel strongly that the ranking needs to be a relative one -- i would go to a pure number system .
we are going to need to assess at each prc whether the organization is strong ( in which case i think it 's ok to have a disproportionate number of high ratings ) or whether the organization has weaknesses that force us to grade tougher .
i think your group in particular has done a good job of emphasizing team work ( and punishing those who do n't play well )
i also like the idea of the abbreviated mid year prc to deal with those we need to counsel more vigorously .
i 'm not sure we can get away with it
i think paul is to be complimented for taking time to focus on the larger organizational issues .... very vice presidential of him ...
i 'd welcome the opportunity to discuss the reasoning and rationale behind the document .
i 've had feedback from a number of the attendees , but i ca n't call it a consensus document .
as always , thanks for the opportunity to make suggestions like this .

to expand brazilian holdings portugal telecom sgps sa plans to expand its brazilian presence by acquiring wireless operator global telecom sa , which operates networks in the parana and santa catarina states .
by acquiring global telecom , portugal telecom would take " advantage of a unique investment opportunity in a high - growth wireless business , " moody 's said in a statement .
continued telecom industry privatization , combined with a " proliferation of start - up companies , " has further limited this option , according to the paper .
combining vendor financing with eca or multilateral credit agency funding could help overcome weaknesses in either financing method , the paper says .
likewise , reaching out to a combination of commercial bank markets and capital markets or entering into strategic partnerships " can reduce project risks by bringing together partners with different resources and expertise , " it adds .

re : intercontinentalexchange , llc stacy - i will have to look at the ice agreement and see if we can add affiliates to the agreement .

texas head coach mack brown has shyed away from giving any indication as to who the starter might be or when the selection will be announced , leaving just speculation as to whether it will be simms or major appplewhite who comes out on the field first sept. 9 against louisiana - lafayette .
but honestly , i think both of these guys could play in the nfl .
that may be looking a bit too far ahead , but for the quarterback with the regal nfl bloodlines , simms has been taking the situation in stride .
he 's brushed off the endless questions about the issue with ease , and in the meantime , has put together a string of practices that revealed a much more patient and mature quarterback than the one abruptly thrust into high - pressure situations toward the end of last season .
a guy like chris gives you a lot of options in your quarterback , between his mental understanding of the game and his physical ability .
he joked the biggest difference in his added strength was " looking better in my uniform , " but simms does think the extra muscle has given him better arm strength and has increased his ability to take a hit , even though brown has not allowed his quarterbacks to be touched this preseason .
i do n't think i could ever do what he could do , " simms said .
i might be able to run a 4.25 forty off a cliff , but that 's about it .
i think you can figure it out , " simms said .
palm announced friday that it will lay off more workers this summer .
we believe that a strong diversity in your fuel mix is a very important part of having a reliable and low cost electricity supply , " grigg told reuters in an interview .
given increasing gas prices and concern for supply availability , i think you 're going to see more people look for ways to utilize coal , " grigg said .
plans for a pipeline that would tap huge unexploited gas reserves in alaska will alleviate the supply situation , but the gas would only start flowing in the second half of this decade .
ray niles , an analyst with salomon smith barney , estimated in a recent report that the united states will need 300,000 - 400,000 megawatts of new electricity generating capacity over the next decade , or somewhere between 800 and 1,000 new plants .
i have heard some rumblings from others that are also recognizing that economics as well as supply issues are starting to look more favorable for coal , " he said .
i will be out of the office tomorrow but please email me with any questions .

gas cracks are still holding the $ 7.00 range , a sign the market is still willing to give gas season the benefit of the doubt but not much more .
the technical pattern looks very much like a bearish head and shoulders(see chart below , i 'm referring only to the most recent range between $ 18 and $ 22 ) .
a close below would signal thew move towards $ 14.00 that looks inevitable for now since the dominant channel is a downward one .
you can also see how we 've had difficulty establishing $ 20.00 as resistance or support ; this is key since it will determine whether the next move is to $ 24 or $ 17.25 .
i would expect a close below $ 18.00 would be coupled with a move back to or below $ 6.00 on q2 gas cracks .
but for now , expect the move back towards $ 18.00 to get funds shorter again , then also expect the market to use those new shorts as an upside squeeze play .
we have been experiencing some technical difficulties , and you may have already received this message last week . ?
i wish you a happy and prosperous new year and good luck .
hope to see you some time .
thank you and great job , quick and thorough turnaround .

on the $ side you may also want to check the blue book value .
he showed great accuracy and touch on long and short passes , and offensive coordinator greg davis , complimented him for having " a quick release .
coach mack brown said he does n't normally want to play freshmen , particularly early in the season , but he said it is easier for wide receivers to play early than for most other players .
their learning curve goes up pretty drastically , and they probably will need some time to cope with that .
we 'll coach him next year , but he can get by with the speed and jumping ability this year .

the proposed revisions deal with eight major areas in new construction dealing with design , density and placement , but not use , of properties . ?
-- the new restrictions would require that any garage facing the street be set back at least halfway to the back lot line , and in any event be no closer to the street than the front of the house itself .
garage - dominated front -- a new provision would mandate that a front - facing garage door could not take up more than a half of the first - floor front of the house , a direct blow at the most common townhome styles . ?
raised foundations -- preserving another dominant characteristic of home construction in the heights , the new restrictions would require either pier - and - beam construction , or other foundation construction that would raise the bottom floor of the house at least 2 feet from the ground .
height restrictions -- the revisions would retain the current height restriction of 40 feet , except that for lots of width greater than 50 feet , the limit would go up an additional foot for every 2 feet of additional setback from the nearest lot line .
density and lot width -- the minimum lot size would be increased from one residence per every 2,500 square feet to one per every 5,000 square feet , and there would be a minimum frontage of 50 feet for each lot .
this would essentially establish a minimum lot size of 50 feet by 100 feet .
recognizing that situation , there would be two important exceptions to the new density and lot width requirements .
second , lots of smaller frontage or size with existing houses as of the date of adoption of the revisions or other fixed date ( to be determined ) would be " grandfathered .
a bracketed bill enacted by the texas legislature in 1999 , applying only to the heights , created a means by which the deed restrictions could be changed , setting the stage for these revisions .
adoption of the revisions would require an affirmative vote of 75 percent of those submitting a ballot .
second , a petition could be mailed or otherwise sent out to all signed - on owners .
the third , and as tiller pointed out by far the easiest , method would be to call a meeting of signed - on property owners .
also , the group that would be most excited about the issue would be those attending the meeting .
we 'll take every practical step we can , and we 'll record we did that .
in any event we 'll be sending out a notice to everyone probably more than once .
the technical issues of presenting the proposals to the neighborhood have to be worked out .
for additional comment or more information about the deed restrictions , check out a copy of the current document online at the heights association 's web site at also on the site is a list of all deed restricted properties in the heights .
their store is in a very nice area of houston .

please let me know what other questions i can answer or if you would like to discuss the specifics further .
- the compression services agreement will be terminated - there will be a 90 day transition period starting 1/1/01within which crestone will build up an operations and maintenance strategy - during the 90 day transition , crestone will make an election as to whether we want all of the o&m , part of it , or recontract with either hanover or another 3rd party ( basically we want the flexibility to do anything we want ) .
- hanover will provide to us a rate stucture that will be in effect during the 90 day transition .
- we will need to address the way new units will be ordered in the future .
- hanover made the committment to maximize on line availability of their units - there will be a 2 year term during which hanover will be crestone 's " preferred provider " of either rented or purchased machines .

we could have an annex for ontario .
we will be using the eei form right across the border in the us .
greg , chris needs the master form asap so we can take the lead on this ontario industry form development iniative .
can you finalize the form and prepare a bullet point memo as requested by chris comparing the differences between our form and eei .
we may need push to get masters signed or rely on gtc in the short term .
while it is my understanding that many participants want to start with the eei form and opgi believes that they already have a next to final form , for obvious reasons
another thing that would be helpful is a brief memo describing the differences between the eei form and our form and the rationale for the differences .
some of this may be readily apparent from running a blackline , but i would like to have the benefit of the knowledge you have built up in developing the form .
my goal is to show up at the meeting and advocate a " canadianized " version of the eei form and then describe the great time and effort enron has expended on this already and table our draft as a starting point .
you can see the revised agenda by visiting the june 21 - 22 entry under i am looking forward to a great session .

instead , these counterparties have been happy to not receive high priced power from us and are filling their positions in the market at much lower prices .
we have received approval from the cash committee for purchases through december 27th ( i think ) and we will secure additional cash to continue on .
the cash desks should prepare a two week view of the positions that we will need to fill and an estimate ( based on spot market prices ) of the cash that we will need to serve these transactions to steve thome .
marketing desk steve thome will coordinate the cash approval process for the west desk .
the marketing desk is responsible for lining up counterparties who will be willing to supply us on a prepay basis .
the marketing desk needs to work with the cash desk to buy power on a spot basis .
whoever secures a supply needs to communicate the need for cash to steve thome .

i understand , however , each book you assign to a trader will have a line so you and i can follow the performance of each book / trader .
ok if you want to take over arb books , but they ( positions and p&l will be your responsibility and will be judged by performance -- like any other book / trader ) must be managed without the team approach of books prior .
i had asked the traders two weeks ago to clean - up the book as much as possible as we approached year end so that we could break - up the book easily in early january .
in the case of ross these are large positions but the back office is making those changes tonight and we can see what the var of those positions is tomorrow .

i made if very clear to them that starting over was a question of rebuilding credability and they should take great efforts to ensure that any positions they liked was put on at a low risk entry point and with small volumes .
to get some of the losses clawed back from friday though i would like to make you aware that this book has about a 3.5 million dollar climb to just get back to breakeven for 2001 .

the earlier advice letter had a lot more specificity about how to deal with applying the credit to da customers that the amended advice letter omits .
we need to determine if we wish sdg&e to include any of the following in their treatment of the credit for da customers .
this would provide the credits to the esp and the esp would be responsible for any future repayment of the cost .
i think we would appreciate a separate line - item identifying the amount of the credit .
because we currently do n't have an obligation to flow through the px credit amount to our customers , i do n't believe we should have an obligation to flow - through the additional credit relative to the cap , but we need legal review of my assumption .
we may also want to consider if we have a preference for how we would handle the additional credit relative to the cap for our customers .
that may help us decide if we want to support having the option of choosing between a line - item or managing those funds for our customers .
( this is another way of alleviating a customer 's concern about a balloon payment at some future date . )

20 nautilus ' development will continue forward .
a positive note equities were poised to continue the uptrend from overseas at the open on mostly upbeat homebuilding data .
october housing starts reflected a softening but still robust market for new home building , while the more forward - looking building permits pointed to a potentially deteriorating situation .
despite the unexpected resiliency in the housing market , buoyed by historically low interest rates , the more forward - looking building permits fell 3.6 % in october on the heels of a revised 2.7 % decline the prior month .
the possibilities you see in others , are possible for you as well .

if not available electronically , i will see it when i am back in the office next wednesday .
if no one has stepped in to a look at hours spent on the confirmation process and opportunities that may be presented there , i will do that when i am back in the office next week .
when we look at numbers of confirmations and compare several months of data we will be better able to identify which activities were stressed by increased business and which activities seemed to absorb increased business more easily .
i also think that jeff will be the best source of information about ideas on streamlining , opportunities to simply life at enron and perhaps create value externally .
no doubt , jeff has some good ideas on where to go next .

harris noted that the electric industry has traditionally operated through various outlets of operation - from the acquisition and delivery of fuel , to the generation of electricity , to transmission and distribution - each operating as an autonomous island with little integration and sharing of data .
the industry should be looking for ways to integrate its functions into the marketplace , not creating new industry silos .
the creation of large rtos under the regional network model that pjm proposed for the northeast will significantly enhance the security and continuity of the national grid .
in addition to recommendations on reliability and security issues , harris highlighted additional ways congress could support delivering real and measurable results to electric consumers .
harris noted that pjm remains concerned that in much of the rest of the country the developing rtos seem to want to remain passive grid operators with no obligation to ensure a vibrant marketplace .
- congress should ensure that the ferc is fully staffed and has the resources needed to appropriately monitor the markets and regulate in those areas where any market is not properly functioning .
the ferc should have these advanced tools and the staff resources to use them in order to identify and be responsive to market dysfunctions in a timely manner .

of this monthly $ 75 bill , about $ 48 is for total generation costs and the rest is for distribution services .
but a great opportunity is about to open up for renewable products as ctcs in the duquesne light territory are about to be eliminated .
when the ctc is removed , the residential customer using 600 kwh per month will soon be able to use the savings to buy wind energy to serve one - third of his / her load - for a total of $ 68 , or a savings of $ 7 compared to today 's default rate .
the dollar impact for larger customers is somewhat higher , but equally small in the context of total electricity bills or company budgets .
for example , a small commercial customer on rate gs / m , such as a restaurant or convenience store , using 10,000 kwh per month and with a demand of 23 kw , has been paying $ 808.52 per month for regulated or default service .
with elimination of the ctc , the bill would decrease to $ 27,220 , but with the pjm - west transition costs the bill may decrease about 14.5 percent , for a total monthly bill of $ 28,320 ; a savings of about $ 4,810 per month .
the savings of $ 20 per month for a typical residential customer and much more for typical commercial , industrial , and municipal accounts , gives pittsburgh a great opportunity to become america 's first green - powered city .

but if you do use the electronic text to substitute large blocks of text , kindly remember that the rest of us will still need to figure out how your amendment differs from the original text .
it would help everyone who has to make sense of your amendment if you could also share a " redline " version that shows the actual changes .
it would also help if we can circulate amendments to each other as early as possible .
this has to be a major transition for you
and if i can be of help in any way , please call .
i 'm sure there will be lot 's of " noise " and people talking to you about options , but i hope you will take some time for yourself to slow down and reflect a little --- you still have a lot of life to live and this can be a terrific breather to refocus on what you value .
good luck to you and let me know if i can help .

the following are our recommended changes to the agreement ( i would also like to discuss the waiver of conflicts section with you ) : page 2 , item ( 3 ) should read " the payment of a " project fee " of $ 175,000 upon the achievement of each milestone described in exhibit a to this letter .

enron shall not have any obligation to proceed with any development project .
at such time as all definitive agreements related to the development project have been executed , the development project shall be deemed to be an approved development project ( an " approved project " ) .
for purposes of payment of the project fee , the milestone shall be deemed to be achieved , for approved projects only , 50 % upon the commencement of construction of the approved project , and 50 % upon commencement of commercial operation of the approved project .
for the avoidance of doubt , a project fee shall not be payable for any development project unless it becomes an approved project as defined herein .

and to the extent anything is agreed to , reopening the settlement is an enormous can of worms , and i do n't think we want to go there .
we would have to be able to structure a side deal to where pg&e and socal are in agreement that the recall rights they got in the settlement can be waived .
and i do n't have a good response to the question of whether our capacity could replace expansion capacity in light of the dueling recall rights , but i will think about it and talk to becky some more .
however , i can call el paso and find out how they interpret it .
we can pull the settlement and see if it stipulates some sort of treatment , but i would doubt it .

hi everyone , i thought it would be helpful to you , in filling out the faculty evaluations , if i explained a bit further how the administration views the quantitative rankings you give to instructors .
if in the next semester the instructor does not improve ( earn a 5.0 or above ) , it is unlikely he or she will be rehired .
please be sure to utilize the full range of the evaluation scale so that we can continue to reward those faculty members who are doing a great job and work with those who need improvement .

but , i would like to dispel the suggestion that jerry put together the spreadsheet for me .
i 'm very enthusiastic about the ar tools that jerry & jim have developed
and i 'm happy that the reports seem to also serve the needs of the finance folks , but i feel like i made it clear that the customer service reps ( like marion ) that are on the front line of collecting monies are the main clients of jerry 's reports .
if the tool needs to be modified to better meet their needs -- then it should be modified .
i believe jerry put this together for you , so your thoughts would be appreciated .
for those of you who are not real familiar with the process , we are attaching all related files to give you a chance to prepare for the meeting .
please bring your copy to the meeting .

at some point we should advise insurers on the changes in ownership and the status of the portfolio as these would be " material changes " to what was originally underwritten .
to whom would you want to delegate this responsibility .
would we want to approach underwriters with the request to continue the coverage for 100 % and include the new owners and new entity as an insured or would we want to retain the coverage only for enron 's 49 % exposure ?
i do n't have a current estimate on the pg&e exposure , however , depending on what is recovered from pg&e , it could impact the first two layers of the insurance .
due to the $ 100,000,000 , aggregate in the chubb layer , it would provide additional coverage for both credit and d&o going forward .
i will attend the meeting on thursday , but will have to leave around 1:15 to make it to a meeting at the doubletree where i am speaking at 1:30 .

first of all , i want to thank you for your participation on the houston ballet board of directors .
i hope that you are enjoying it .
in addition to the table that we buy annually , we are also giving houston ballet $ 15,000 .
since you are involved with the ballet , we thought we 'd see if you 'd like to ask your team if they would like to be the volunteers .
spouses and children ( older than 14 ) are welcome to help , too !
please let me know if this is something that your team would be interested in !
steve , could you check on the status of our invoice # 21074601dated 2/19 for $ 2613.61 .
please let me know if you would like me to send you a list of the many advantages in using the iso standards .
i asked ken lay this question a few years ago , but he thought we should use local customs ; however , as we are becoming more international and more internet - based , the iso standard is becoming more advantageous .
enron is working with those parties to develop a common proposal .
the word is that reliant will also leave -- we 're hoping for a big splash saying both southern and reliant have left .
the rc has now introduced a slightly new proposal called " voluntary " -- the concept being that you may opt for nodal or zonal on a month - by - month basis .
this had not much support at the meeting at the iso on may 10 and 11 -- especially since you end up with nodalism anyway .
i also included apx 's " flowgate " model , which has some intriquing characteristics and which we can support with some slight modifications ( it 's very close to what we have proposed , and may be easier to use in a world with more parallel flows than we have today )
this is a great opportunity for your group / business unit to entertain clients , prospective customers , or host an employee event .
in addition , please be advised that we also have eight ( 8) season tickets that are available for your use - so please let us know if you need tickets to any games throughout the uh basketball season .

might want to check with aew to make sure she has n't taken care of this already .
we need to decide what we are going to do for thanksgiving pretty soon .

also , i know that the sept invoice had originally been sent to dan lyons since we also were doing related work on the brazos project and dan was the supervising attorney for the project overall , but my understanding from dan was that he was going to send the litigation related invoice to your attention for your review and approval .
i hope that you are doing well and bearing up ok in the face of the day to day turmoil in ca .

hi shona , thanks for the update
although the urgency of the situation was stressed when requesting this information , we followed up with an email on october 10 to dan houston ( attached below ) when it appeared that they would not be able to provide us with the information - the email gives an overview of the project and stresses the urgency that we obtain the documentation .
i have not heard anything from pam regarding a meeting , but today looks good .
tomorrow and wednesday i will be in l.a. thanks , shona , ken ----------------------
kyle gibson has helped us with the settlements by providing some invoices and g / l entries for selected transactions .
we understand that the monthly close will prevent kyle from helping us any further until tomorrow at noon at the earliest , and that he will be absent this afternoon .
in fact , part of the testing evaluates the ability of a group to pull together all of the supporting documentation for a selection of deals within a short time frame .
it is important that we be able to mention in this report that the settlements group is able to gather this information quickly for a small number of transactions ( 10 overall - although some information has already been provided by kyle ) .
are there any other resources in your group who would be able to help us meet this deadline ?

i was wondering if you could help me find new generation work within your company .
if you are not in the market for additional capacity i would appreciate your comments on how i might proceed .
we have a rather strange assortment of equipment to support our work , special hydra lift trailers for moving large engine without disassembly , cranes for use in trying areas , high voltage bucket trucks , a portable repair shop that can be moved to a major site that is 100 ft x 60 ft and is fully equipped for anything from turbine repairs , installs or we can do a large rewind ..
for off - shore work we have a floating shop , a service vessel that has equipment on - board to move generation or also do similar service and repairs .
sometimes , in addition to supplying new equipment , we can supply used , refurbished or surplus assets .
this is a partial listing so let me know if your company contacts are in the market for anything in particular , we may be able to help .
these are additional properties i am working on , we handle turnkey installations all over the world as well as a good deal of offshore work .
delivery can occur within approximately 120 working days ( 4 months ) after receipt of funds as specified below .
a control room will be provided together with switchgear and circuit disconnects .
the costs will be adjusted accordingly if additional or substitute equipment is required by customer .
we will offer this equipment under separate contract .
to prepare a formal quotation and provide detailed equipment specifics , i.e. model numbers , serial numbers , etc . , a one - percent ( 1 % ) cash advance shall be placed in an escrow account with draws for the preparation of same and expenses incurred .
currently , we have a " window " of opportunity open to immediately initiate necessary engineering work .
the protection and control systems will be replaced with current solid state systems in accordance with the requirements for a new installation .
in accordance with a standard factory warranty for new equipment of this type .
anything is possible , but i would say not in the near future since the original investor deal fell through .
you 'll probably want to be familiar with it since we 're recommending a $ 10mm limit on the regulated portfolio , and it 's losing $ $ $ .
we 're simply imposing a limit on existing risk , but given the significant drop in pge earnings vs. prior year , investor relations is expecting some interest and the bod might be aware of it and ask for clarification of our risk management practices accordingly .
total costs will rise to $ 325 m , which will potentially expose pge for approx .
the structure mechanism will have additional features : o a tighter band than the 2001 mechanism o tiers of sharing , with less sharing as the variance between forecasted power costs and actual power costs is larger , positive or negative .
this will help enlighten you as to what portland can look like .
the attached was prepared by amin maredia last week , as we were getting up - to - speed on pge 's cost sharing mechanism and a potential drop in 3q earnings .
i 'm not sure if i have your right email address , but i 'll try it anyway .
this is a test to see how your memory is > working .
with that said , it is probably not necessary to undertake this effort for mid - year prc purposes since we are probably moving to a three peer stucture where that split could be achieved ( for year - end purposes where the compensation impact would be felt ) .
following my note last week please find attached the consolidated peer group mapping for all business units .
we were considering moving to a 3 peer group structure however it as agreed at the last prc committee meeting to stay with the current structure since the data had been cleaned and everyone felt generally comfortable where most activities had been placed with the exception of just 2 or 3 .
it was agreed that we should concentrate on resolving these rather than undertaking an organization wide remapping excercise to consolidate to 3 peer groups .
please return your comments to david oxley by friday may 25 .
sorry ... there 's a conflict on monday ; therefore , the meeting referenced below has been moved to 4:30 pm on tuesday 10/23 .
at the request of mark taylor , a meeting to discuss the master netting agreement with mark haedicke has been scheduled for monday , october 22 at 2:00 - 3:00 p.m. in mark haedicke 's office ( eb 3325 ) .
michael , i met amy today and look forward to working with her .
thanks for the heads up about her arrival here in the states .
i understand that amy fitzpatrick will be moving from enron europe to portland in the near future as her husband is relocating back to the states .
as you will no doubt be dealing with amy going forward , i thought i would let you know that she has worked extensively with myself and jon chapman and is also the hr rep for the legal department in europe .
she has done an outstanding job and is an absolute pleasure to work with , so we are very disappointed to lose her .
we need to start thinking about the best way to approach wfec after this petition is filed .
it sounds like alabama electric cooperative is the way to approach this .
might be useful to approach it through that relationship .
do you have some time where we could get together and discuss potential issues ?
we will not be giving up clearing to another clearing agent .
we will be clearing this activity through csfb .
david port should be contacting you shortly .
i would like to make the temperary var permanent .
i hope you are well . ?
if you could provide an e - mail of the final or hard copy that would be great .
kay - as you can see from the below , it appears that epmi has a confidentiality agreement with green mountain .
if possible , could i get a copy so that we can conclude negotiations on an nda for net works .
it will be good to see you .
thanks for the note .... remember that on nng , gray is an exempt point (
this should have pretty good value for the summer ( value similar to your west texas lateral ) .
we could carve out a few minutes after one of the morning meetings to discuss this with market services - both tw and nng representatives to work out the details for their shop .
i had requested earl to provide an update on this interconnect .
should we start working out the details of that ?
adjacent landowners survey has been completed for pipeline shpo & f&f survey being completed on pipeline route valves has been quoted for a 8 -12 week delivery , unacceptable .
the existing gray county i / c will be relocated to p-3 as a complete unit
dry flow measurement installation will be t&m to reduce time frame for bid package and drawings and allow quicker contractor move in and start up .
we should have the otc margin analysis through october soon .
we can update that report for today .
particularly i am looking for otc margin analysis with updates ( including all counterparties and with october ) and also i want to know the actual nymex balance as off yesterday
let me know if you have any questions or require additional information .
case may require attention at that time .
i was asked whether tw could install a stand - by compressor unit at the gallup station in the event the unit was down due to scheduled or unscheduled maintenance .
please coordinate the installation of any temporary compression with the certificate department .
we should send you a confirmation by now .
mr. paul , jeff asked me to see if i could find out when the homecoming is taking place .
he 'd like to be there if the dates work with his schedule .
the new stadium is supposed to be awesome .
thank you and happy new year !
thank you scott , we now have nearly all of enron 's complete bidweek information , including those in the mid - continent region .
and i hope you have a great holiday weekend .
this means that northern will need to track both the costs and revenues associated with offsystem transactions .
we believe that in tracking the revenues we can track by contract .
therefore , i believe in the meeting that if we needed to track these transactions
we also said dan fancler would need to review and determine how we would track the revenues thru the accounting side .
i 'll let you know where we are as things develop .
based on our meeting 10/9/2001 , i would like to propose the following accounting procedures for expensing in - kind fuel .
reconciling items such as in - kind fuel reductions will be reported to storage marketing noting that purchases for in - kind fuel replacements are needed .
we may wish for the vender to issue two invoices .
you and her negotiated a stipulation on or around may 15 , 2002 between enron and keyspan energy delivery - new england
sara : just a few additional thoughts on this list as possible topics : 1 . credit event upon merger - seems like more counterparties want to define the " materially weaker " standard .
3 . minimum transfer amount - how it works and how it is different from the threshold 4 .
please rsvp to me by tomorrow if you will be attending the party on saturday .
you 'll be pleased to know that i registered over the web version of telebears this morning .
by the way , if it would be easier , i can call your contact at mirant .
eei changes ron and i discussed your comments .
i think you need to retake it and be honest with the test and be honest with yourself .
could you give vince a call or an email to recommend that he kick in 16 k for the institute for international finance ?
can you count us in for a slice of the cost and advise me how many others depts you can recruit to help pay the annual fees .
i will also be looking for others to buy in .
i will discuss the costs within the research group and advise you of how we will proceed .
on the oxford analytica front , i 'm glad you have found the service useful .
our current contract is for $ 50 k or $ 10 k per user per year .
we can charge $ 10 k back to you .
since we took on these services last year , we have expanded our range of sources and projects and are consequently trying to do more with less .
some follow up on friday 's meeting : we need to focus quickly on whether or not there is any deal to be done with middle east suppliers that can contribute to enron europe 's power project in spain .
our pending deal with adgas to ship lng on the heogh galleon could be a good fit however the current volume being discussed ( 0.3 mmta ) is only a small portion of the 1.3 to 1.5 mmta required for the project in years 03 + ( minimum delivery would be 1.0 mmta ) .
we also need to determine what we believe is the most effective pricing structure for the adgas lng purchase ( both in terms of supply to our project in spain , but also for potential diversions to europe in 01/02 ) and for what term .
based on our discussions on friday , it may be that a crude based purchase price may work the best .
we will likely have to share , in some way the shipping savings , if we divert to a non - u.s. terminal
but i think we can keep any upside made on the indexed portion of the price for ourselves .
in addition we will be contacting oman lng to determine their ability to provide quantities to augment the adgas supplies , as well as potential shipping options ( exmar ? )
i would also like to look at how elba could be used as part of a potential take or pay avoidance strategy for the spain power plant .
i will try to keep everyone updated as the pieces come together .
the marketing dashboard ... a business tool created for you
i can live with the other language if need be .
you guys should try to set a time to leave next friday .
i will probably go to woody 's thurs if i have a good week .
i should have no staffing additions next year .
i think that everything else should roll for next year .
yet i think i can get him a ticket .
before we meet with vince tomorrow - i thought we should drop you a line and give you an idea as to what 's been accomplished in the first week as well as some of the challenges and problems we 've run into .
this way we can make the most effective use of vince 's time .
we prepare a 1 page summary and give an idea as to any particular forecast biases - whether we feel things may come in warmer or colder than the model .
in the future we would like to be able to gather raw data from the avn and mrf to provide a series of choices which could be input into their demand models or at least be able to give them our " best pick " of guidance and how we feel things may deviate from that pick .
of course between 1000 and 1330 we are looking closely at the us weather for support to you guys in houston .
they would like to be able to gather objective output from as many forecast models as we can get .
we expect to have this completed tomorrow .
the research group has asked for assistance in gathering climate data across spain for temperature and precipitation .
contact chris mahoney to determine if we can provide and additional support for crude and products .
* we 've been told that we will be moving locations next week - which might entail corrupting or loosing the software and hardware configurations that have taken almost a week to get fully established .
this will make it very difficult to stay connected - as well as very difficult for our customers to identify us .
assembling reports both physical and electronic can take nearly as long as actually preparing the reports !
mike , ok - i think that brings you up to speed .
i 've been amazed at the amount of feedback we 've already gotten and we 've only been here 3 days !
on that note i wanted to let you know that i am fully committed to this project .
i am also open to remaining in london beyond the 27th to ensure the success of this project .
hopefully this gives you a good idea as to what 's gone on in the first few days here .
we look forward to talking to you later today and with you and vince tomorrow .
ken , i want to tell you that your comments yesterday at the employee meeting were uplifting , encouraging and inspiring .
mark , please add hong kong to the list of locations requiring due diligence , eta and pa .
enron corp. they would like to conduct an informal interview with you at your convenience .
research we look forward to hearing from you .
attached is a copy of the tx label that has been prepared for small customers .
as we discussed if ti is looking to differentiate their fuel mix , i know that elliot and richard will be able to help you from the rec commodity end .
they will provide the default system mix for spot purchases by year 's end .
i 'm glad to answer any further questions .
i think that will be fine .
i do n't think it will take long .
hi anjam , thanks for the info .
also as you are very busy and away from your desk could you set up your lotus notes calendar so mary ward and joe kelsey permission can see your calendar so i can get in touch with you if anything comes up .

i will report fully on the meeting by telephone tomorrow morning , however , this report summarizes the principal issues covered in the session .
if they find that it has , they will recommend curative legislation .
we are to let him know by wednesday if we will produce the current version .
duke asked dunn to delay the production date for iso for a few days until they can work out the terms of the confidentiality order .
he has few resources for litigation- nor has he resources to review the millions of documents he has requested .
they certainly seemed willing to play ball at the meeting- although privately they may have other plans which they did not air with dunn .
i told him i would ask you guys .
the southern system expansion will coincide with a similar expansion of 200/day on northwest pipeline scheduled for june 2003 .
scheduled to be in service in 2002 , the expansion will increase the delivery capacity from the nova gas transmission system to ang at the alberta - bc border and from ang to pg&e gas transmission northwest at the bc - idaho border .
here are the prepared comments to be passed out at the ferc conference tomorrow morning .
we enjoyed seeing you , also .
thanks for letting us crash temporarily at your house .
we briefly discussed the global facilities database , but we all have agreed to concentrate on the feasibility of the contracts database first and leave the facilities implementation question for a later date .
if ees does agree to utilize global contracts and facilities we will need to set up a separate ees maintenance group within global .
ees has informed us that they would like to do all of their contracts data input .
two global employees would be assigned to work directly with ees 's personnel on a daily basis .

mary , i have been working on a clearing initiative for enrononline in the past two months .
i would like to seat with you to discuss where our initiatives might overlap each other and where they might complement each other .
i know there 's a lot of anxiety about severance , reflecting the possibility that the existing enron severance plan might be changed .
for purposes of the foregoing obligation regarding severance , the term " severance benefit plans and arrangements " shall not include any individually negotiated agreements .
kit blair has started working in volume management today .
prior to enron , kit worked with starbucks coffee company as a store manager and as a financial analyst .
please welcome kit to our portland office !
also , we would prefer , if possible , to keep the distribution of the charts as narrow as possible .

in order to do so would ena please provide the following : 1 ) a copy of each month 's midland power electric invoices back to october 2000 , 2 ) the net book value of the interconnection facilities , and 3 ) a copy of any other contracts , leases or other agreements that are necessary to provide the compression services at the station along with one years worth of historical cost for each .
new flagship store opening 11/01/01 in new york city !
this is why rusty and i could n't find any alkaseltzer in any stores ! ! !
thought it might be helpful for all of you to have the list .
dexatrim vitamin c / caffeine free please discard any of these medications as soon as possible !
, thank you for sending the agreement draft on friday .
if you wish to discuss those further , perhaps we can schedule a time on the phone .
the attrition rate should calculated based on the number of existing clients at the beginning of the agreement without taking new clients into account .
we would like to see something that more tightly defines electronic trading of wholesale commodities .
we would like to retain the ability to offer these services in areas where enron online is not active , such as supply chain systems , and in the retail markets for large commercial and industrial concerns .
it would be good if that were written into this section .
i believe we can live with this clause , but it would be better if it were not there .
we 've added several new products to our line of outstanding fresh and frozen seafood .
we 'll keep you posted as we add additional product to the site .
it 's a great time to stock up on your favorite frozen foods or save big on fresh seafood for your favorite maryland recipe .

if you feel in the mood to experiment , many different kinds of fish can be found at your local seafood market .

jim asked me to send to you the attached filing we submitted in the three northeast rto dockets ( pjm , new york and new england ) urging ferc to consolidate the three rtos into one based on the pjm market design structure .
that would be very helpful for my analysis .
jeff & susan , per your request , i have outlined potential rebuttal testimony points for your consideration .
i recommend that we minimize our testimony to distinct points without extensive elaboration whenever possible and/or coordinate our ideas into socal sponsored testimony .
i think we need to play this problem as we have been , through private off line discussions .
if the indicated producer group members can get comfortable then we will find the right means to modify the comprehensive agreement .
transwestern has operated its own ferc pipeline system under such a protocol with great success and customer satisfaction .
the pis proponents suggest " it may be possible to put a system of capacity rights into practice , " .
the pis proponents suggest that a " bottleneck situation " could occur at the socal citygate .
in view of potential new storage development in socal , this citygate capacity could even increase .
so rather than a " bottleneck situation " at the citygate , socal customers would reasonably expect to enjoy even greater capacities than currently available at the socal border .
socal and the parties assured that socal has the full opportunity to sell either operational available firm capacity or interruptible capacity at anytime .
the comprehensive settlement offers a real long term improvement for generators .
i am very happy that you have been promoted to managing director .
i spoke with bill windle this afternoon and told him that it was unlikely that we would be in a position to talk with ace by 4 tomorrow .
he would like to try and have an internal call with ourselves and you sometime tomorrow if possible .
i 'm going to be unavailable from 10 - 2 tomorrow , but could you please give leslie hansen a call and let her know what if anything we can accomplish tomorrow ?
if you could pass along this information i would appreciate it .
michael , wednesday afternoon after 3:00 would be good for me .
i am currently director of tax for the enron india business unit and have been with enron in various tax functions for approximately 5 years .
i want to make certain we both take full advantage of the prc process .
with this information , i can be best prepared to speak of your achievments during the 19-july prc presentation .
i would like to meet you in person and hope that we can arrange that early next week .
we could use that time to run through your background materials .
please furnish the name of your " prc supervisor " by email ( my list indicates it is tom martin ) so that i can contact them for a copy of the business unit prc materials that should have recently been completed for you .
hi lisa i 've been trying to call but to no avail - could you please try to reach me at 713 853 6349 thanks
also attached is a draft term sheet for the preferred stock of azurix that would be issued in exchange for the principal amount outstanding under the credit agreement between enron corp. and azurix .
.. i saw that i 'm not working for the thanksgiving holiday .
i do nt mind working if someone else wants leave on that day .
the start date for the northeast guys will be nov. 1 .
the decision has n't been made regarding what is up for grabs , but all the stuff 's pretty nice as you know .
to make things clear , to qualify for the draw you must put in my hands a completed file folder with an initialled checklist on the front and a signed release form inside .
some completed folders can be found on the desk beside jason biever - invasion is a good example of a completed folder .
it should also be noted that we always need a signed release form before we send out a cheque .
if you should so require , angela or megan can put together a blank folder for you to fill in .
also , if you have a completed file without a release ( i.e. if it 's a reinstated contract which is flowing to termination like domtar ) tell me and i will make sure that management makes a decision on whether it qualifies .
i 'll email the contenders out tomorrow around noon
i will give you a head start .
extending the deadline to mid - month would make compliance easier and more accurate .
therefore , we have tentatively scheduled a meeting next week , while we are in d.c. for a technical conference on the el paso reallocation issues , to meet with selected staff personnel to discuss the reasons we do not see any need for changes , although we are willing to accept a designation of affiliates engaged in electric generation development as marketing affiliates .
maybe if things work out , we can stop by and say hi on sunday on the way back , if we get back early enough .
louise , looks like i missed you at noon ; i apologize for the room mix up .
we are happy to sit down with you this afternoon or tomorrow if you would like to walk through the documents in greater detail .
le bin can help you recover files that you accidentally deleted .
took a stab at the ones that i thought i could answer .
i will be back in the office on monday but will try the site again in the interim .
guys , anything you can do to encourage your employees to take a little time to participate in the survey would be much appreciated .
ill. allegheny has been building and buying facilities in pennsylvania but last month gave the first signal of its broader aspirations , announcing plans to build a 1,080-mw unit in arizona .
gift of art ready to be opened
attached is the midland weekly report - thanks to sherry scarberry for typing the report this week .
questar is interested in finding ways to minimize the impact of this testing on its shippers .
as the spreadsheet is currently built , when inserted , these amounts should be on a pre - tax basis .
if you have any questions , i will be in the new enron building and can be reached on my cell at 713 - 345 - 7751 .
thanks heaps to both of you .
but it seems very small for significant customers and we can change it to us$ 10,000,000 .
as this amount is usually agreed in the master agreement with major commercial banks , we hope this is acceptable to you , too .
john - i guess you may need to consider above with sara .
how flexible do you think we can be on this ?
i was thinking a good time would be friday for a late lunch ( around 1:00 ) .
but , i want to make sure this fits with your schedules because we can always have it on saturday .
hope all is well with you guys ! ! ! !
that filing is 17 pages long , however , i 'm not able to print the last page - - i 've tried everything !
i 'm sending the first 16 pages to you via interoffice , and i 'll have to get with tech support on monday to find out about that last page .
open new markets - work jointly with legislative team by providing technical analysis and testimony etc .
post transition period market structure - participate in proceedings establishing terms , conditions and pricing for such issues as provider of last resort and default service .
if you have any further questions , please do n't hesitate to ask .
anything that you could do to encourage archer to consider this will be of great help .
but i know his support will have a tremendous impact on the westside and we need that . ?
therefore , the only trigger for a fee would be an active title v permit .
your input will be used to help determine the future of these programs , identify new programs , and provide the basis hopefully for a doe supplemental budget increase .
you should at a minimum submit your recommendations in writing to doe [ instructions contained on page 2 of the announcement]. b. be as specific as possible and cite success stories as well as failures .
brief comments are also welcome to show general support and/or need for improvement or termination .
please be as constructive as possible to help restore funding for those programs you support .
c. please provide me with copies of any written comments by email so the alliance can hopefully incorporate your suggestions in our written comments as well .
can you please send me the attachments .
i 'd like to talk monday to find out what happened here and hopefully bring in ed essandoh who has been working on our swap products .
i would like to get these out on tuesday at the latest .
so the volumes can be fixed in rgs if needed .
russ and i had discussed these deals with you a few weeks ago .
" for us the key to making a curtailment program work is automation .
even if the correlational term structure is to be done for power , different rules would have to be inputted for different regions .
thus joint estimation of factors for a few regions does not look realistic .
instead we might implement the term structure of correlations .
instead of heaving 1 correlation matrix based on prompt month prices and applying this matrix to all maturities , we can have a number correlation matrices each corresponding to a particular prompt month .
you can see that : 1 ) the results are close for 5 , 4 , and 3 months of history ; 2 ) correlations are periodic with a period of 1 year ( this means we can use 12 correlation matrices calculated from first 12 forward contracts and apply these matrices to other forward months ) ; 3 ) using decay factor makes the curves a little smoother .
please , give me your response , thanks , tanya .
i have committed to mike middleton that we can begin the hp comparison tests the week of may 7 - 11
ken i think we need matt and a div person to do the testing .
gary , i hope you will be able to share modeling data of the pipeline and compression and what might be accepted if full utilization of their hp is achieved .
ken , will we be able to share any of the testing results for stations 2 , 3 or 4 , resulting from the compressor work .
if we can , that would be great .
if you wish to visit before the call , lets do , otherwise i look forward to visiting with you wednesday .

if you need any assistance , please let me know .
we knew flow would be down for november and operations took advantage of the situation and did some work on the pipe .
the truth is that i hand picked key members of the team and transferred projects that we were already undertaking in energy operations to round out the suite of products to be offered through commoditylogic .
i just thought that it might be helpful for you to have the facts so that you are fully informed whenever you are involved in conversations around commoditylogic .
both have proven in the past to be good project leaders .
we started the project shortly after the tremendous ramp up in natural gas volumes due to eol transactions .
molly had been a member of the contract exchange project team , and we transfered her along with the project to commoditylogic .
it is input from my group that has created the modules by defining user requirements and they have served as the testing teams as well .
during the five months that she was assigned to commoditylogic , mary developed a plan for contactlogic that tom feels is excellent and notes that it is an important complement to the other modules .
early in the project , i had also selected two very key and knowledgeable operations professionals to be part of the commoditylogic team - leslie reeves , who played a significant role in building enron 's power business from day one , and todd hall , with experience in natural gas and emerging products .
thanks for setting this up for me .
i think i 'll be home for christmas .
i may be calling you between the next couple of hours .
i had a spanish speaking attorney in our office assist me with their review .

before the end of the year , i requested that bill initiate contact to you regarding our north texas project .
after fple execution , i will return a copy for your files .
i hope to make a houston trip in the next few weeks and would like to meet with you during that visit .
also , i believe bill may have requested an east texas area gas quality analysis and pipeline pressure information .
rob , please review the attached listing and advise if you agree to the project and amount listed as billings that enron north america will receive in 2002 for support of this effort .

> did n't sound like you , but i thought i would ask .
in last week 's monthly close process overview training class , we discussed the payment and refund functionality in tis .
since we can not go back and change the information that we reported for the 1st or 2nd quarter 10qs , those new payments / refunds have to be reported in the 3rd quarter .
if you realized today that a refund should have been entered in tis for may business , do not enter that refund in may business .
if , however , you realized today that a payment should be entered in august business , you can enter that payment in august business because august is part of the 3rd quarter which is the quarter we are currently reporting .
just do n't change any dollar amounts or add any new amounts .
the consolidations group has finalized the 3rd quarter payment and refund information for the 10q that is due tomorrow .
if you need to make any changes to payment / refund amounts in tis , please contact mary sontag .

mr. budhraja was observing what has happening in the marketplace at the time , reading the newspapers , and saw what he thought to be a good opportunity to purchase these stocks .
i think as many high - ranking people as possible should be filing these so we know of potential conflicts , " he said .
at the time of the results announcement last month , jeff skilling , enron president , warned the unit was unlikely to make a profit by 2002 , as the company had earlier predicted .
with increased activity ( and ) increased transactions , we still have a good chance of breaking even in that business by year - end next year , " he says .
in the meantime , enron is cutting back its spending on bandwidth significantly , to dollars 73 m in the third quarter and to dollars 40 m by next year .
enron expects more pain ahead for broadband but does not plan to buy any more fibre .
enron is also excited by signs that the us regional transmission grid for wholesale electricity could be opened up .
dabhols power project in maharashtra , the largest single overseas investment project that india has ever attracted , has been the focus of controversy since its inception in the early 1990s .
with the boundaries of congressional districts about to change in redistricting , the money could come in handy to scare off challengers or allow a politician to get to know new constituents .
he added that the governor 's staff needs to update financial disclosure forms for january through july in light of the state 's taking on a power - buying role for insolvent utilities in january .
i think the reason we could not complete a comprehensive project was we did not have the mandate from the ceo office to do it so that relevant commercial and functional entities can provide the required information .
great intuition on your part in trying to get such a risk measurement tool implemented .
i wonder if you were able to advance that project and i now wonder if greg whaley would be interested sponsoring it from his office .
i would love to be the ' commercial ' lead interfacing with you to get such a project done now since it may help us with relevant ( risk worthy ) disclosure .
i would like to roll this out sometime in january .

iris from the initial work that i ben and i have done , data availability for the moody 's model is relatively good for european companies .
you may be aware that s&p has a similar model .
we met with s&p earlier this morning and they will give us logins that i will forward to you .
i have not looked at the details , but it appears to me that the moody 's model could be more relevant for our purposes as the s&p model is calibrated of companies that s&p has rated , whereas moody 's has actually got data not only retsricted to the firms they rate .
for us counterparties , there may be a problem as private us firms do not need to publish accounts .
in any case , quality data is probably one of the most important issues to be resolved going ahead , and this is likely to define what companies we will be able to price and influence model selection .

a key focus of the conference was the growing focus on online exchanges and how the entire value chain for the wholesale energy market is being impacted by new technologies .
we do n't know a whole lot about them yet , but a group of utilities in the midwest recently proposed a transmission exchange that would " be the electronic clearinghouse of information flow around transmission assets and the market .
finally , the retail online providers could also be considered a form of exchange in that they are operating exclusively across the internet .
with that established , several key issues will rise to the forefront in 2001 as many exchanges finally come online and the new business segment enters its second year .
the second trend as we move forward is liquidity .
i think we will also see multiple exchanges merging into one to gain a lock on various market niches .
i think we will see more and more of this trend as traders demand this option .
as always it is a pleasure working with you .
this will confirm our understanding that provided you clear any potential counterparty with the ets credit department , it will not be necessary to get clearance for such counterparty from the legal department .

it is impossible to identify all such factors which could cause actual results to differ materially from those estimated by the company .

dpc did a great job of describing the current situation in a balanced manner ( yes , there are both positives and negatives ) .
olng was pleased with the information they received .
olng 's agenda , which is to cooperate to make the project a success , even if it involves some renegotiation and ( b ) shell 's agenda , which may be to force the project into default to create an opportunity for shell to step in and take control of the only lng terminal that will be built on the west coast of india in the foreseeable future .
dabhol is one of several projects that oman had hoped would successfully build ties with india --- and each of the projects has run into snags because india has not held up its end of the deal .
the three of us believe that dpc should consider either going short lng or replacing at least a portion of its lng contracts with an egm supply contract , with egm deciding what to do about coverage ( i.e. , short or long ) .
hope you have n't been waiting for it .

martha noted that her boss and others in her area will be out most of next week and that she honestly could not tell me when she thought that dep would be able to discuss its position on the nox limitation , although she thought that it might take two or three weeks .
i indicated to her that we wanted to meet to discuss dep 's position on the nox limitation and , if dep agreed that we had met our burden concerning the 42 ppm , then we wanted to discuss the potential avenues available for minimizing any loss in hearing time ( for example , by publishing the amended notice as soon as possible , stipulating that the existing parties could amend their petitions to add in any new allegations and stipulating that any new parties may join the existing proceeding ) .
martha then suggested that additional environmental analysis may be required and that epa may need to become involved .
with respect to her comment about epa , i can only speculate that al or other representative of the air permitting staff wants additional comfort and may seek epa 's involvement .

this will help manage enron 's liability .
with respect to section 4.5(b ) , we are concerned about the confusion that may occur if enron has an obligation to seek restrictions on another trading platform 's use of transaction data .
enron 's ability to proceed with any transaction will be substantially hampered if it needs to be able to prove to accenture that it is using commercially reasonable efforts in the context of a negotiation ; this is very difficult to prove .
we need to discuss how to calculate and apply the standard transaction fee .
accenture had provided that it start when accenture began to offer tsh services , which could be indefinitely in the future .
one additional safeguard may be to add rights for operational audits .
do we need to come up with a way to exclude new industries and products that may be offered in the future on enron 's website .

interviewed last october , when enron 's shares were still trading within sight of their dollars 90 peak , mr skilling picked data storage , logistics and credit instruments that support business - to - business e - commerce as three areas in which enron believed it could make a market .
with the benefit of hindsight , it seems that enron was guilty of plotting a rosy future on the basis of exceptional 1999 - 2000 growth in some technology sectors .
it 's like working on a high wire without a net .
the last year has seen a more sober assessment of those prospects , even though many analysts still believe enron 's push into different areas will be rewarded .
stephen moore , of moody 's investors service , notes that enron continues to obtain significant new business and believes even its troubled broadband unit offers potential in a market with expectations of exponential demand over the long - term .
leaving voluntarily , skilling would have collected a cool $ 2 million if he 'd hung around for another four months .
as i mentioned in my voicemail to you today after seeing the note from neil mcgregor , there is no possible way that anshuman could be in the us to work on february 5th .

i agree that george is well suited to origination , but he has also spent quite a bit of time looking at investment opportunities for koch in a wide variety of industries that they are active in .
if egm is looking at several acquisitions , i could see him being the point person for egm on transactions and thus able to relieve some of the burden on the folks focusing on trading .
however , i know that george is happy at koch , so it would have to take a very exciting opportunity for him to leave , i.e. , something where he would feel the job was " tailor made " for his skill set .
very bright guy would be most useful running an origination group do n't think he would have any interest other than at that type level .

given that we have latitude in our project scope , our team would like to assist enron in evaluating a new market opportunity .
we believe that a project of this sort will give us the opportunity to really learn how enron creates value , what its business model and core competencies are , and how they can be translated to a new market .
furthermore , we can get an in - depth understanding of an industry .
we believe our project will complement any analysis that your business group is currently undertaking .

i haved attached some information regarding marte 's other questions and would be happy to discuss with the team .
if we impact areas ( even within existing facilities ) that were not previously disturbed we are required to include environmental data about those areas .
i want to feel comfortable that we are supplying the required information to ferc .
for this project , that would primarily include a description of the existing vegetation and soils ( resource report 3 and 7 ) .
all we would really need is a brief description of the existing vegetation and soils , and how much will be permanently impacted , etc .
my hope is that we can find an answer to whether the site was previously disturbed or not .
if not , i hope to come up with some verbiage that everyone is comfortable with to satisfy the ferc requirements .
otherwise , we will have to obtain the necessary information , and that 's beyond our initial scope .
if you have had any biological reports done for the area on other projects , that may provide enough information .
also , we need to verify for the other 3 stations that we are constructing in previously disturbed areas .
lastly , arnold has indicated that the hydro - test water will come from existing water source at each station and that it will be discharged under transwestern 's blanket permit .
please verify ... and i think we should provide a copy of the blanket permit with the filing .
after you have had a chance to think about this , please call and we can discuss .

including enron on the creditors ' committee : pg&e may have the opportunity to influence representation on the creditors ' committees .
there are several reasons to suggest to glynn that we be included : 1 ) we are a big creditor , 2 ) we could be helpful in crafting a broader solution , and 3 ) we are one of the real parties in interest behind the px and iso ( who were listed as significant creditors but are really just " passthroughs " for the suppliers ... and pg&e likely would not want to have those political bodies serving on the creditors committee anyway ) .

( i will need to follow up with sanjev at slaughter and may who is co - ordinating the european side )
note , though , that we will not be using isda documentation , since it is unnecessarily complex for the product contemplated ( described below ) and using the gtcs approach will tie in more neatly with online .
of course we will also need to look at local regulation in each target jurisdiction .
also note that we are looking for a harder ( more certain ) definition of bankruptcy which will be relatively easy to ascertain in each case .
early warning type events will probably be out and court based or other formal proceedings which are readily verifiable will be in .
the issue is perhaps more a commercial one - we will need to think carefully about the impact our public betting on the bankruptcy of our counterparties will or might have on our business relationships with them .
the proposal needs to be analyzed more closely from the perspective of three principal regulatory schemes - securities , commodities and insurance .
with respect to the commodity exchange act , if the derivatives are executed as swaps , they will need to satisfy the cftc 's swap exemption and , if executed as options , they will need to satisfy the trade option exemption .
with respect to insurance , there could be an issue as to whether the credit derivatives constitute insurance .
this determination as well will depend largely on how the derivatives are structured .
as a result of the foregoing , it will be necessary to obtain more details regarding the structure of the proposed transactions .
it will also be necessary to determine how bankruptcy events will be defined .
presumably the definition that is used will need to provide for some period in which the proceeding might be dismissed .
also , the definition will need to take into account the possibility of non - us bankruptcy proceedings .
we also should obtain more information on the manner in which the derivatives will be priced and the manner in which such prices will be published or disseminated to clients .
please call us if you have any questions or would like to discuss these or other issues further .
if you have questions regarding this procedure , please contact your > account manager .
in regard to the counterparties we are going to focus on first -- i need a further prioritization of the list with approximately 160 counterparties that i believe you had prepared .
i think i need the top 50 , the second 50 and so on .
but i will begin revising this afternoon to submit for approval )
attached you will find last week 's energy analysis which includes information about vicente fox 's energy team .
in the course of the implementation process , the iso has > determined that the actual amounts of capacity that will potentially be > available to participate will be below the maximum for any of the listed > services .
also it should > be noted that while the solicitation will be open until the requested > capacities are reached , the current timeframe of the summer 2000 trial > program and the applicability of the " relaxed " technical standards runs > only through october 15 , 2000 .

addressing this concern could be as simple as enacting a bylaw amendment or more likely an amendment to the articles of incorporation .
thus , i would suggest that you request a conference call with the national office agent or " team " reviewing the application , and get them to identify each and every concern with the application .
and of course , be mindful that if you have had ongoing activities , you will want to be sure that anything you do will result in retroactive deductibility for what contributions you have already received .
if your client would like our firm to help as a consultant to work with the national office , we 'd be pleased to be of assistance .
we would need to review the file and have your client execute a form 2848 power of attorney for us to join the team .

let me know if > you guys think we can try to hammer this out next week after the take home 's out of the way .

he had played in six of charlotte 's eight games this season , posting a 3.0 ppg average and a season - best eight points against new jersey on november 4 .
he could be sidelined for up to three weeks .
scott pollard will start at power forward if webber is unable to play .
updated 11/16/00 najera has had a diminished role with the mavericks since starting at small forward in the season opener .
dallas has sinced moved greg buckner into the starting lineup at shooting guard and placed michael finley at small forward in najera 's place .
his current slump could be attributed to the fact that he played small forward in those games .
it may be wise to stay away from finley until he regains his shooting touch or moves back to shooting guard .
this could lead to a diminished role for miles .
if you drafted tsakalidis you may want to give up on him for now and add a center that plays on a regular basis .
jamison will alternate at the forward spots until starting power forward danny fortson returns from his foot injury .
his scoring will remain about the same but look for jamison to grab more rebounds at the power forward position .
the rounders updated 11/16/00 jones missed last night 's game in new jersey with a strained calf .
rose , who was expected to play in the game , will now likely wait until sometime next week to return to action .
obviously , i came back too soon , " said majerle , who was hoping to play in tuesday night 's game against charlotte before the injury occurred .
he suffered a swollen right eye , but should be available for wednesday night 's game against the pacers .
rose is expected to be in the starting lineup tonight for indiana 's central division matchup with the detroit pistons .
fantasy owners who drafted rose should be thrilled by his return , and hope he can duplicate his solid numbers of a year ago .
patterson might be worth adding to your fantasy team if you play in a deep league .
sabonis was impressive in his season debut for the blazers tuesday .
starting power forward danny fortson will miss the next three games due to a sore right foot .
he will most likely remain in the starting lineup until starting power forward danny fortson returns .
i do n't know if i 'll be able to go thursday .
vincent , i got the e - rating and default probabilities for promigas from the credit group .
could you plug in these numbers to the loan guarantee model ?

we will update the council on new markets we 've added to the enron portfolio through enron networks , ( most recently metals and paper ) .

good afternoon ron , we just had a meeting with bill williams , head of real - time trading in portland , to discuss some problems we are having with the real - time deals flowing to the deal confirmation system .
one possible solution has already been examined and that would be to have the real - time traders use deal entry to make all the changes .
also , and more importantly , the time to make all the changes for the real - time adjustments in deal entry would make it impossible to keep up with the high volume of deals we are now seeing .
thanks , david poston it manager , portland
please review the attached letter and forward comments to me asap , so that i may forward them to anne .
i have received no comments from wade on my signing , but i have his approval for the study , so i will proceed on that basis .
we could use that as template and proceed before friday on that basis .
that is the thing i am looking for most - the raw information on what the grid and stack looks like .
i was not able to download my messages in time for the calls , but i will be on going forward .
the study will get us the despatch forecasts for the next 8 - 10 years , and will deliver the results by january end , per henwood .

celeste and i counted 12 weddings we got invited to this year between the two of us and also sometime this summer , celeste and i
i 'll let everyone know about the invite , but it may be easier for you to let me know next time you come in town .
again , sorry we were not able to make it down for the wedding .
i think it is safe to assume that the wedding was a bit more fun than the first communion we went to that saturday .
hopefully , you will hold off on populating the earth with any more florval 's .
i may try to get down there sometime late summer or fall .
if this plan is passed , ( better than 50/50 chance -as reported earlier )
thanks my sweet little sugar , love you and miss you .
i think we are finishing tomorrow .
i do n't want to redo the other 13 opinions until we know we are at the end .
here as requested in today 's phone call are my notes on hong kong/ singapore for use in writing your questionnaire : the regulatory structure in wayne 's e - mail is proposed because of a number of regulatory characteristics of japan which may or may not each apply in hk and in singapore .
we should go through each of the regulatory characteristics of japan and determine if it applies in hk and then in singapore .
from conversations with clifford chance / hk , already i am pretty certain the hk and probably singapore as well differ from the japan situation in several ways , such as : in hong kong : - no half circuit requirement .
we buy capacity from a properly licensed hk fixed network carrier - may be way for us entity to be used for most of the transaction .
but again , which is better for us , a us entity or a hong kong/ singapore one , tax - wise and regulatory - wise .
in singapore , we need to see if it is like hk
but i think it probably will be close .
we need to come up with a model suitable for the hk situation with input of locally based telecom lawyers and do the same for singapore .
additional notes from the call : robbi will take lead to identify singapore telecom law firms , and whether clifford chance is the right firm to continue with in hk .
i will proceed with the arthur d little consultant contract for analytical support for our pioneer status application in singapore , working with anthony duenner .
i will proceed to progress the singapore license application using the existing singapore entity .
robbi will look at the question of additional directors for the company .
hello : i am working with a group of lawyers organized by the bar association of the city of new york to help identify emergency funding sources for small businesses affected by the world trade center attack .
the idea is to help them secure short term loans and/or grants so that they can stay in business during this difficult period .
i am able to investigate the various sources of government funding ( sba , fema ) but need your help with finding sources of private money such as foundations , corporate funds , the september 11th fund ( ? ) .
also feel free to pass this message on to any others who could help .
i know a lot has changed since then , so if we want to take this to the board this time we will prepare the information as you suggest .
dash resolution please send at your convenience , but by next monday for distribution on tuesday .
there are a number of different groups who will be looking for this information .
following attachment is chilling calc for ft devens - which was the nearest site we thought might be representative of lowell .
obviously if you have different design point due to your owm plant data or your own criteria , we would be glad to rerun / size based on your suggestion .
- i need to find the procedure and/or worksheet on how we got the 1 % point - i ca n't see it in this package .
the following is the data we developed and provided to a possible austin , texas job .
generally these should be concidered as 1 x 100 % unit ( capable of supporting 10 hr day ) - if run more , truck water from decker , call for emergency trailer demin , can operate units on limited water but would see nox increase i need to run performance by our management and then get tom 's blessing before i send .
2200 tons with two cell tower deliverables uae needs to send water quality data to enron .
in addition to the 6 weeks that enron allows for leave , i am planning on adding to that period and using any remaining vacation time that i have for 2000 which i believe is an additional 10 - 12 days .
and as you are aware i am not sure how long i will take but
but i should know more after next wednesday .
if you are planning on taking any additional time , it must be cleared by your supervisor prior to you leaving .

dear dale / all , thanks for the interest ...
as you suggest , what would be great is if we can get some more content in terms of well - explained introductions to various topics like value - at - risk , credit risk and so on .

the mseb has know that the power station could not do the required ramp - up in a cold start for nearly 2 years during which time performance ( of a sort ) has been tendered by the mseb .

in a seminar on stock market development , the institute presented a paper calling for expanded participation in investment banking by domestic financial institutions .
to promote investment banking in korea , the institute said measures should be taken to build reliable databases of economic and financial statistics , foster experts , encourage brokerages to develop their underwriting capabilities , expand the concept of securities and encourage business crossovers among financial institutions .
according to the institute , the global financial market is experiencing a transition from direct funding through banks to direct funding through stock exchanges .
the pursuit of large size and business crossovers will intensify in the future .
at the same time , progress in financial engineering and information technology will give rise to more complicated financial products , which will further liven up indirect investment instruments , " it said .
the institute said foreign financial institutions ' inroads into the domestic market would increase , helping domestic institutions improve their business practices and financial technology .
jones)- a top banking watchdog on wednesday held out hope that laws dealing with derivatives transactions and bankruptcies may yet be updated this year .
it would certainly be a better world if the bankruptcy and insolvency provisions were finalized .
there 's a chance that could happen , " he said .
the second session of the 106th congress is expected to adjourn by early october as lawmakers make their way home for the fall campaign .
brosnan said he hoped they could get to the provisions in a pending bankruptcy reform bill dealing with derivatives contracts .
it is my hope that that would occur
and i think it would make for a safer and sounder banking system , " brosnan said .
to the extent you could get one or both of those finalized in an agreeable format , it would add certainty to u.s. banks , " brosnan said .

before last month , the udcs could only make limited forward purchases in the ca - px 's block forward market , for only certain times of the day and little flexibility .
while the construction of new generation and transmission facilities in california would naturally increase the competitiveness of the ca - iso 's energy and ancillary services markets , the msc believes fundamental market reforms are also needed .
the geographic distribution of generation unit ownership can allow some owners to exercise locational market power during certain system conditions .
the supply side of the udc 's business would be unregulated , except the requirement that it offer a fixed default retail rate for each customer class .
further , the supply side of the udc 's business can forward contract or purchase on any of the ca - px and ca - iso markets in any manner they find profitable .
finally , among other things , the msc recommended ( 1 ) replacement of the current ca - iso replacement reserve policy with a real - time trading charge , a penalty for the oversupply of real - time energy , and the cost of out - of - market calls being assigned to the over - consumption of real - time energy ; ( 2 ) a greater emphasis on the market - power implications of proposed market rule changes , including reconsideration of the current out - of - market payment mechanism , the ca - iso 's 10-minute settlement market , and pg&e hydro divestiture agreement with the ca - iso ; and ( 3 ) expedited siting and construction of new or expanded transmission and generation capacity in california .
we hope to co - sponsor the 2002 workshop with the center 's brand new institute for law and technology , another membership - based division of the center of which i am also the director .

melissa - i just wanted to let you know that i can definitely get this list to you today .
comments eur swaps flows generally light , with a continuation of the front end receiving action from tues pm , in both 1y1y and 2yr , albeit in smaller size into the dramatic sell off .
5yr underperforming curve badly , with 2 - 5 - 10 's fly around 13bps here , there are a few offside posns at these lvls who could well get blown out if we push much further .
the market appears to have little appettite for risk at the moment as dealers appear to have been burnt over the larger more prolonged sell - off than expected .
we are pretty indifferent at these lvls & are seeing limited domestic interest , but can see it continuing to trade quite expensive , at least in the short term , due to the equivilent richness in the 5yr deliverable german sector and the scarcity of alternative bonds in the 07 area .
eur views financial markets have been keen to anticipate a recovery in global economic activity .

however , those talks could also be influenced by whether enron is further downgraded by major credit - ratings agencies .
ralph pellecchia , credit analyst for fitch , said he could n't predict what effect the sec filing would have on enron 's credit rating , but he added that the document contained damaging disclosures .
some also pointed to a sentence in the sec filing that said " it is possible " that continuing enron reviews will " identify additional or different information concerning these matters .
the enron sec filing gave new information about the effect on company earnings of transactions related to the ljm partnerships .
the new york times page 1 , column 2 c. 2001 new york times company you'd be better informed if , instead of listening to what we say , you watch what we do . ' ' that excellent advice was not issued by enron management , although it should have been .
takeunder would be a better term .
that company may or may not be enron .
' if enron 's finances grew more confusing , dynegy seemed to offer clarity .
dynegy and chevrontexaco are also privately considering whether to offer a bigger cash infusion to buoy enron 's credit rating -- now just two notches from falling below investment grade -- if the agencies look askance at the current deal .
the companies are hoping for a response within the next day or two , the executives said .
the executives also said dynegy was seeking further protections that would allow it to back out of the deal if new , adverse disclosures surfaced .
however , the effective industry bailout that the merger would represent would probably lead to some leniency from the f.t.c. , and would probably be looked at with some relief by the f.e.r.c. ' '
mr. plank said he hoped regulators would take a critical look at any deal . '
some industry officials said yesterday that a deal with dynegy was increasingly looking like a do - or - die prospect for enron , as other energy - trading companies began to back away from the company and take their business to other trading companies .
a rating below investment - grade would make it ` ` difficult if not impossible to raise new debt and would severely hamper their ability to trade , ' ' jefferies & co. energy analyst paul fremont said .
bankers are lobbying moody 's to make a quick decision so an acquisition could proceed , according to the people .
` ` it would be true for us , and i would think for many others , ' ' he said .
an acquisition of enron would make dynegy the biggest energy trader and a leader in managing energy needs for commercial and small - industrial customers .
that includes investment partnerships that led to a $ 1.2 billion loss for the company last quarter , as well as other deals formed by the company 's former chief financial officer that may have been a conflict of interest .
it would make a good case study on what happens when you fly too close to the sun .
they were also designed to help the company grow quickly without adding too much debt to its books or diluting the value of the company 's stock .
joint energy development investments l.p. should have been consolidated back onto its books in november 1997 .
the new company would be a global powerhouse , " he said .
government regulators would have to review a merger , looking to see if too much market concentration would result .
however , i do n't think it 's as easy as it sounds , " he said , adding that a successful merger would take the correct incentives to convince enron 's traders to work for the new company .
if master market maker enron goes down , this winter could be a truly chilling experience for north americans.(enron corp. in danger of defaulting)(brief article )
those of us who thought the energy industry would escape the great technology bear market may have been too complacent .
since these contracts extend years ahead , and since the other parties to those trades are relying on enron 's ability to cover its obligations , the risks to energy prices and supplies could be enormous if enron were to default .
many u.s. energy producers locked in high prices by making huge forward sales .
according to a report filed with the sec , it wanted to start a chain of full - service , white - tablecloth italian restaurants " based on authentic italian regional recipes .
a report on its web site suggests the stock is " an exceptional ground - floor opportunity [ for the ] investor with vision .
it says the big board has made " significant progress " in regulating brokers , but deficiencies remain : among other things , the nyse needs to improve surveillance of floor members , ensuring that regulators are on the trading floor to watch for potential violations .
no doubt the nyse 's regulatory improvements are commendable -- just hope it does n't take another two years for the exchange to get its practices completely up to par .
the hewlett family , which still holds a 5 per cent stake in the computer company , announced it would oppose management 's plan to merge with compaq .
maybe investors should be looking for that change .
but buying enron stock in the hope that the valuation will turn out to be above the present price may be a slightly ambitious strategy for even the most well informed investors .
if dynegy had announced a package of asset purchases rather than a stock deal , you could have wondered whether they saw value in enron as a going concern .
also , this is probably a " once in a corporate lifetime " opportunity to put together a merger of such large companies with the likely quick approval of antitrust regulators .
there was no chance that the federal reserve or any other government entity would or could step in to assume responsibility for liquidity in the traded energy markets .
so enron 's $ 13bn of debt is most likely a good buy , and you are getting it at close to bankruptcy prices .
if the companies combined , they would create a $ 21bn behemoth in the energy sector with unparallelled energy - marketing skills and financial resources , " says christopher ellinghaus , an analyst at williams capital group .
it has also been looking to expand its wholesale operations well beyond a uk presence .
dynegy 's online trading platform , dynegydirect - which helped raise the company 's recent third - quarter earnings 22 per cent to $ 286 m - is seen as a good fit with enron online .
dynegy is also an important trading partner for enron , demonstrated by the fact that enron has helped bail out its new suitor in the past from potential trading losses .
analysts say there would be a big shake - up in the energy markets were enron to fail , although some say the volatility may be only short term .
most analysts believe a deal could be done , but approval could take more than a year due to market issues and the complexity of the two companies .
any major negative consequence to enron would affect both physical commodities prices for electricity and gas as well as have a negative affect on financial energy products .
enron 's demise would not only hurt the thousands with exposure to the group through its trading operations ; it would also would have a spill - over effect on other energy traders if investors backed away from the entire sector .
out of respect for enron 's presence , my sense is the industry has tried to give them the benefit of the doubt to see if they can resolve this situation , " says michael zimmer , of law firm baker & mckenzie .
the group 's banks , due to meet today , want to secure $ 3.3bn in unsecured credit lines drawn down in the past month .
but they may not be able to renegotiate the terms unless enron 's situation worsens sufficiently to trigger a default .
enron might look cheap , but the stock has collapsed for good reason .
a rescue by dynegy and chevrontexaco corp. , a major dynegy shareholder , could provide enron with $ 1.2 billion in cash , according to sources familiar with the negotiations .
another possible outcome could be a major investment in enron by dynegy and potentially other energy companies , if the right collateral can be found , sources said .
not everyone has been able to do it .
however , the picture could be even worse .
if so , the ljm2 deals were n't as arms length as enron might want to project right now .
the ljm2 number is certainly larger , but in and of itself the equity number means little when you look at sheer size of the deals ljm2 and enron did together .
through the raptor deals , ljm2 agreed to make enron whole for losses sustained if the assets declined in value , and it hoped to profit if these assets went up in value .
however , to make hedges of this size , raptor would 've needed adequate cushion against potential losses .
rival dynegy inc. however , the action still left analysts wondering whether further negative disclosures might be coming .
some analysts suggested the deal has problems and could pose new risks for dynegy .
a massive restatement like this does n't look good .
both trade on the new york stock exchange . .
analysts said enron ran into trouble with its strategy to create partnerships to purchase assets such as fiber - optic lines that enron wanted to move off its books .
they protected its credit rating , helping it to obtain favorable interest rates on its corporate borrowings .
small - capitalization stocks ended lower after retracing solid intraday gains , with the bulk of the selloff taking place in the final hour of trading .
the small - cap market was able to post slimmer declines than the overall nasdaq market because of the strength of financial stocks , which make up the largest industry group in the russell 2000 following technology .
investors from wall street to main street sought a piece of the action as enron reported bigger and bigger profits and executives boasted they would successfully apply their energy trading strategies to other markets as well , including steel and broadband communications .
wall street analysts admitted they were stunned by the rapid demise of enron , but said a merger with dynegy would help improve enron 's credibility .
but investors should always be looking for as much financial visibility as possible and steering clear of any company that can not -- or will not -- provide it .
the domestic lenders have tried to facilitate a meeting between prospective buyers and the seller as we have a common interest in saving this power project from going bust , " saxena said .
` ` tata and bses are keen to buy the project but much will depend on the terms enron sets , ' ' said v.k. saxena , chief general manager at industrial development bank of india , or idbi , the country 's second - biggest lender .
but until i see terms of the deal and more important conditions , i 'd be cautious on making any judgements .
on thursday , the wall street journal reported that dynegy and enron are in talks that could lead to a merger in a stock swap worth $ 7 billion to $ 8 billion .
a merger , according to a number of sources , would help prevent big troubles for many energy companies .
we see this [ the potential collapse of enron ] as a situation that has potential downsides for the entire industry .
in some ways , it would be a natural fit .
ideally , they would combine the two .
kevin boone , an analyst with bear stearns in new york , said the top 20 energy companies in the u.s. would n't likely be able to encroach on enron 's former share in the marketplace if dynegy and enron merge .
chevrontexaco , which recently completed its own merger , may contribute about $ 1.5 billion to push the deal with dynegy and enron forward , according to published reports , and analysts had varying opinions on chevrontexaco 's involvement in the talks .
others said chevrontexaco would be interested in enron 's pipeline assets and one analyst said the oil giant 's aa credit rating from wall street would help the combined company grow .
investors were disappointed because they had hoped dynegy would announce it would buy its beleaguered rival .
dynegy will have to recalculate enron`s worth based on the restated numbers and as for those restated numbers , it may not be the last of those restatements .
and that may also mean any deal may be dragged down .
fred , thanks very much for being with us .
according to eitf documents dated 1989 and 1990 , a minimum outside investment of 3 % or more in a special purpose entity may be necessary , depending on the credit risk , for it to qualify for non - consolidation status .

without a way to plug the gap between supply and demand , california can expect a long , dark summer .
whether this summer will exceed that number of days or not depends heavily on the weather .
although power plants that were offline for maintenance aggravated the situation , the week 's two blackouts " tend to indicate that the blackouts we 'll have as we get further into the summer will be deeper and more sustained , " said zenker .
the governor 's latest , $ 800 million campaign to encourage conservation could save an additional 2,061 megawatts by summer 's end .
but energy experts say davis may be overly rosy in his projections for cuts in home consumption .
but much of it was based on getting dozens of small energy providers to either increase output or build new facilities .
i felt a fairly large amount of optimism was built into ( the peaker plan ) to begin with .
projections and reality : new power in california gov. gray davis pledged to get 5,000 megawatts - the expected gap between demand and production - of new power generation online in california this summer , but only 1,698 megawatts will be ready by july 1 , with 3,669 megawatts expected by sept. 1 .
some additional megawatts may come online through small peakers being licensed by the california independent system operator . .

i just wanted to drop a line and see how work , your new apartment / roommate and brendan are all doing .
regardless , this deal is good for travel through the end of february 2001 , so .... if it does n't look like it 's going to work before the end of the year , maybe i could make a visit mid - january or february .
to recap our recent discussion , my understanding was that you were looking for an enron or nbp entity to serve as the lessor in a lease financing transaction that would be offered as an option in the pending eamr bid for the trailblazer construction project .
since such transaction would need to be priced based upon the credit rating of the entity or the sponsors ( depending upon the structure ) the expected returns will not justify the balance sheet impact on northern border partners if this entity were to function as lessor .
at that point , we would work with commercial banks or major leasing companies to develop a cost - effective financing transaction .
i hope this addresses your questions regarding the feasibility of such a transaction , but please call me at x7843 in omaha if you wish to discuss further .
sounds good , but i could n't open the file .

billy our external counsel are reviewing the authority of fmpa to enter into the proposed transaction and will also advise as to the required representations and other specific due diligence we will need to conduct prior to entering into any such transaction .

and experts warned that a deal with pg&e will be more complex than with other utilities .
electric co. however , any such deal still would need federal approval .
the state would upgrade the high - voltage lines and lease them back to the utilities for operation .
big customers might be able to bypass the utility 's remaining local distribution lines , thereby eroding its customer base .
commissioner carl wood warned at the last meeting that failure to provide safe and reliable service could mean fines for the utilities .
he explained that no power company would agree to a long - term contract if rival firms could learn the terms of the accord .
it has to rely on the good word and expertise of the governor , and he has yet to demonstrate that he has expertise or good word in this field .
if we could look at the terms of the deals , we 'd see that california is being gouged for 10 years , " said heller of the foundation for taxpayer and consumer rights .
ackerman of the western power trading forum said the state had gotten the best rates it could under current market conditions .
in the long run , you need to send the right price signals to consumers , which will create its own conservation signals .
davis insists the crisis can be resolved without raising rates for edison and pg&e customers beyond " the existing rate structure .
battin acknowledged that he has received campaign contributions from some wind power generators but said there is no connection between the donations and the bill 's provisions .
but the added prices that would have been paid to the generators would have translated to at least $ 19 million in the next five years , to be absorbed by southern california edison customers , according to one analysis .
we deliberately bought 50 % so we 'd have a good mix between long - term contracts , which may turn out to be somewhat higher or somewhat lower than the spot market , " and purchases on the spot market .
bilas has proposed an alternate ruling that would allow the utilities to make the cuts , but provide for puc monitoring of service in case the commission wants to step in later .
even with the 40 long - term deals announced by davis on monday , experts interviewed tuesday said , up to 43 percent of the state 's daily needs may have to come from this highly volatile market , in which power is bought within a day of need .
that could could prove hugely expensive , because some spot market energy has cost five to six times what it would under the long - term contracts .
it 's widely expected that consumers ultimately would have to pay that tab , which could amount to billions of dollars .
if all that power has to be obtained on the spot market , the price could be high .
still falling short even if those hydropower imports are available and conservation works as davis hopes , it 's likely california would still require the spot market for 11,000 megawatts to meet the august demand .
fearing the annual bill for that power could hit $ 2.4 billion this year , pg&e wants the tab sent to the department of water resources , which also is buying power on the spot market for the state .
` ` we 're looking for clarity on a number of issues ' ' regarding how the spot market will work ` ` and certainly that 's one of them , ' ' said thomas hannigan , the water agency 's director .
the conflict was sparked by a vote by county supervisors yesterday to aggressively explore possible sites for new power plants throughout the county .
the measure by supervisors mark desaulnier and federal glover , which passed on a 4-to-0 vote , directs the county administrator and department of community development to compile a report on possible sites within 45 days .
supervisor donna gerber abstained after criticizing the plan for potentially repeating the same mistakes that plagued the state 's energy deregulation effort by not considering how much energy the state , region and county will need in future years , and how much power is slated to come online .
the site could hold up to three small 50-megawatt peaker plants , and a larger 15-acre natural gas plant , said steve thomas , managing partner with golden state .
thomas said 30 acres could be kept as open space to form a buffer around the project .
we believe that the site is ideal .
i do n't think that pittsburg or east county should be the dumping ground for energy for california , " said beals .
contra costa county supervisors took tentative steps tuesday toward allowing the construction of at least one small power plant before summer , ordering that its staff identify potential sites in unincorporated areas within seven weeks .
gerber said the county should examine the potential for additional power plants within its borders but not investigate individual sites yet .
fifth district supervisor federal glover backed desaulnier , but said he hoped for a location outside his heavily industrialized east county district .
desaulnier said he believed a peaker plant could be built about a month after final approval .
supervisors also heard from the potential developers of a 650-megawatt plant between bay point and concord .
the thomas site could house a peaker plant until the proposed larger one goes online .
desaulnier seemed cautious about the larger proposal , which he had described last week as " a good site .
a resident who lives near the thomas property asked the board to " build it ( the larger plant ) closer to where you have industrial areas .
the business roundtable has estimated the need at roughly $ 90 billion , though no number can possibly be exact .
in highway construction , in developing water resources , in finding enough university space to accommodate the tidal wave ii of students , managing demand is likely to be as crucial to any solution as new construction .
in the energy market -- and in electricity particularly -- it 's been a familiar principle ever since david roe of the environmental defense fund first persuaded pacific gas and electric that a dollar invested in conservation may be worth as much as the same investment in new generation .
in any case , says dowall in one of the ppic reports , we should pick which major projects we will build not just according to per capita estimates of how much we need , but according to how much consumers are willing to pay for them .
in california , they also could be adjusted to encourage summer school classes and other off - peak uses , rather than ( as in the past ) making uc summer courses more expensive .
in addition , gov. gray davis ' infrastructure commission is expected to recommend better coordination of infrastructure and land - use planning when it issues its report this spring .
as california state treasurer phil angelides has pointed out , the state desperately needs to start joint planning -- regional planning -- for housing , roads and other resources to reduce the need for long commutes ; to preserve open space ; and to bring jobs to where people live and housing to where the jobs are .
in the east bay , slow - growth forces push well - intended initiatives that would force more development into tracy or modesto and further tax the transportation systems to silicon valley .
we do n't just need better capital planning ; we need a whole new planning system .
it 's extremely important to the residents of our community to follow a plan we worked hard to produce , " she said .
lee said that type of permit is one the city has the right to approve or not depending on the project 's impact .
he said parcels within the east dublin area that could host a station would include those zoned for public and semi - public uses , including land recently bought by oracle and sun microsystems for new campuses .
while dublin officials testified that one buyer of land in that area paid $ 86 per square foot , others suggested land prices would be inflated to help make a pg&e land buy look prohibitively expensive .
an executive of centex homes , the developer of new houses near isabel avenue and concannon boulevard , objected to an alternative route that would place high - voltage transmission lines overhead along isabel and stanley boulevard .
the utility 's project would place overhead lines and a transmission station on rolling hills that the family envisions as one day being public open space with limited development , richardson said .
judge cooke is expected to recommend an alignment by july to the puc , which will make the final decision .
within the next few weeks el paso plans to apply to build a 571- megawatt , $ 400 million plant in the same area , company spokesman jesse frederick said .

the web site always has been somewhat under construction , but the pace is going to be a little heavier than normal between now and the end of the year .

both versions added a concept of " master netting agreement " as a new definition and as an add - on to the definitions of forward contract , swap agreement , repo agreement and securities contract ..
we were hoping to see an amendment to this section that broadened this language to include any type of payment that would be due from the debtor under a forward contract since we are still unclear as to what a " settlement " payment means .
if you look at section 362 ( b ) 17 which deals with swaps , this language is much broader and it was our hope that the setoff language for forward contracts could track the setoff language for swaps .
also , we were hoping that the setoff language for forward contarcts would apply to anyone taht was a party to a forward contract and not just " forward contract merchants " as currently drafted .
finally , we like the fact that the definition of " swap agreement " was expanded , but are concerned with the new language and how it would apply to our newer products such as weather derivatives since in order to fit within the new definition , it must be something that is currently or in the future " regularly " entered into in the swap market .
there are some further revisions to that definition which i want to discuss with you as well .
call me when convenient so that we can discuss what the next step for us may be .
dear all , i would like to make myself available for some meetings at the oslo office during my visit on friday pm , monday and tuesday .

i hope to discuss the vol curves and will bring the example of the recent work done for the uk electricity desk where a monthly volatility curve generator and initial half - hourly forward volatility curve have been developed .
to support the on - going effort to ensure the accuracy of the energydesk.com systems , i hope to help james stephen nail - down the reasons for some of the discrepancies between the energydesk.com valuation and the oslo book ( for this i hope to meet with trond ) .
if everything runs smoothly , i plan to roll - out the new asian model which should also help us in improving our electricity volatility curve .
look forward to meeting you soon !
thanks - it was settled about 6 months ago .

while competition in the backbone network business is booming , new technologies coming into the market will make it much easier to increase bandwidth available on any fiber - optic network tenfold or more .
and that step may be more difficult than building the networks themselves . '
the combination of major new network construction and new technology for adding network capacity has led industry analysts and executives to predict a bandwidth glut that is likely to drive down prices in backbone transport of data much as the price of long - distance telephony has plummeted in the past few years .
rather than a free fall in prices , however , expect the market to quickly find new ways to use bandwidth , both in terms of network - based applications and bigger backbone networks to support the rapidly growing field of faster access via digital subscriber line ( dsl ) and cable modems .
capacity can be added without any backhoes .
dwdm technology and optical amplifiers , which boost the power of a laser 's signal over a given wavelength , enable bandwidth to be added and allow signals to travel farther without the need for as many repeaters to boost signals along the way .
also coming into the market by 2002 will be new sonet gear that quadruples the current transmission rates from 10 gbps to 40 gbps .
we think we can do it because we are building a green - field network that does n't have the cost of legacy technology like circuit switches .
greater bandwidth and lower prices also will enable new video services to be delivered over the internet , says vab goel , vice president of ip engineering and technology at qwest .
we think this network will drive cost down and increase performance for value - added applications which can be delivered over an ip network .
in addition to enabling new services , however , the sudden availability of bandwidth will dramatically change the way services are priced and sold .
it 's the next great challenge of the internet - deciding how you are going to bill customers and what they will be willing to pay for , " analyst bernstein says .
providing those applications - or at least building into the network the right hooks for new services - is the best hope for building a new revenue base , harris agrees .

i would really like to talk to you about this at your convenience .
as you may know from john , we have been very involved with the tex mex transmission line project that we have done with bpub and that has just received board approval .
we have a very good relationship , i believe , with bpub , the port of brownsville and their respective counsel from that transaction .
john also seems to believe the deals with bpub and the port will be structured along the same lines as the transmission project , and as the draftsmen for not only the docs with bpub , but also the port , we are also obviously very familiar with these documents as well .
could we possibly talk about this project at your convenience ?
we would really like to do a deal with you and your team and given our background on the first project , it would seem to make a lot of sense from your point of view as well .
i would be happy to drop by to discuss staffing , timing , etc .

indeed , unless you simply have n't been keeping up with the stories of how brokers are getting rich with big commissions , and feel a bizarre need to help out the brokerage community , you should maintain a strong bias against annuities .
those payments may start at some date in the future or they may start on the day you buy the contract .
your investment in the annuity will earn a return , and those earnings will grow untaxed until you receive annuity payments .
a fixed annuity thus provides a steady retirement income -- but this steady return can and will be eroded by inflation .
when used , the payments under that feature would initially be lower than a fixed payment , but over the years the payments will steadily increase at the specified rate .
for those expecting to live many years , the added cost of this feature might be worth the price , but expect to pay dearly for this option .
while these subaccounts may invest much like a mutual fund , subaccounts almost certainly will have a different and higher expense structure , and possibly a far different return than that of the public mutual fund .
still , over the long - term , a variable annuity invested in a stock subaccount should provide a much better opportunity for inflation - protected income than a fixed annuity .
a recent innovation in the insurance industry , an equity - index annuity is a form of a fixed annuity contract tied to a stock index that provides the opportunity to earn returns better than those in a traditional fixed annuity , but less than those of a direct investment in the market itself .

this metaphor at least has the advantage of helping us keep in mind the sort of critters we are dealing with .
a year ago , gray davis was riding high -- because californians were prosperous , confident about their future and thus supportive of the political status quo .
history indicates that davis should still be favored to win a second term , but if riordan does become the republican candidate , he would have at least an outside chance of unseating davis .
state tax revenues are in a nosedive , running a billion dollars under projections in the first three months of the fiscal year , and davis will be compelled to make multibillion - dollar slashes in state spending that will irritate important constituent groups .
however large the state 's fiscal problem may be , it will be much , much larger if the state money davis spent on power purchases this year can not be recovered from a proposed bond issue .
davis could try to renegotiate the contracts , but that would be admitting that he and his advisers erred in the first place .
the effect of the current flap over bonds and power contracts , as well as davis ' months - long effort to provide a bailout for financially strapped southern california edison , and his lackadaisical performance earlier in the energy game , will undermine the governor 's claim for a second term .

( adds reason for decision in first paragraph , background starting in third paragraph )
-- enron corp. 's collapse means europe 's energy market , which the company helped create , will become a riskier place .
` ` it has been incredibly important for european trading and for the market in general . '
opportunity rivals see a chance to grab the customers enron may have to leave behind -- like upm - kymmene oyj , which said it may seek another company to help manage its risk on electricity prices .
officials there could n't be reached to comment .
if a criminal investigation began , it would most likely take place in the houston office , though new york could assert jurisdiction since the company is traded on the new york stock exchange , the journal reported .
-- enron corp. 's collapse means europe 's energy - trading market , which the company helped create , will become a riskier place .
rivals see a chance to grab the customers enron may leave behind -- like upm - kymmene oyj , which said it may seek another company to help manage its risk on electricity prices .
with enron out of the way , dynegy may be able to expand its energy trading business .
since then , it has been ousted from trading on the european energy exchange and the german high - voltage grid has been closed to enron .
ruhrgas , also europe 's largest gas importer , may be faced with finding alternative ways to supply gas if customers need additional supply , he said .
we are able and willing to use the flexibility in our long - term contracts to support them , " he added .
i 'm scheduled to move over there next week , and i 'm still being told to be ready to move .
the eex said it has the necessary structures in place to cover " any open positions which may be held by enron at the eex .
troubled u.s. energy giant enron corp. ( ene ) said friday it will decide on the future development of ongoing power plant projects in japan by the year - end , kyod news service reported .
the statement was in response to a request by the northeastern japan prefecture thursday that it continue the project following reports that enron may collapse .
, said he 'd hold hearings on enron in the near future and asked staff to begin immediately investigating the energy giant 's financial collapse .
and the early reports from major mutual - fund companies suggest that even individual investors may not suffer as much as they might .
and should the economy continue to falter , more bankruptcies and defaults could emerge , the likes of which could indeed create broader risks .
pitt said he hopes the sec will complete its investigation promptly , but added , " it would be inappropriate for me to say what the sec will do .
new york -(dow jones)- prepare for the largest test in bankruptcy history of safe harbors designed to protect the liquidity of the nations ' financial system .
these safe harbors were developed over the years as a sort of security blanket for the vital hedging functions that these transactions provide .
given the large number of parties involved and the magnitude of enron 's recent losses , the treatment of derivative contracts could be further complicated by the market 's lack of understanding of just how much value is left in enron 's assets .
but the extent to which those cases provide any lessons for enron and its derivative counterparties remains to be seen , experts said , depending on what sticky and complex issues might arise in potential court actions .
key to how well or poorly counterparties will make out now that enron 's business has been all but dried out , is how much if any collateral protects their transactions .
this network enables us to provide reliable supply , risk management and logistics to our customers , as we have done for the past 16 years .
we hope that someone will buy the nordic unit , and are working on several concrete alternatives in order to make that happen , " thor lien , head trader at enron nordic energy , told reuters .
lien said the nordic unit seemed cut off from the flow of information as enron 's headquarter in houston prepared for the biggest bankruptcy protection in history .
it is total silence , " he said , adding that enron nordic would have to line up a buyer fast if it were to stand any chance of surviving .
if the parent company goes bankrupt or files for chapter 11 there would be no company within the structure that could survive , " he said .
it can not be determined at this point what effect , if any , enron 's circumstances could have on teesside 's operational and financial performance , ppl said .
we would be interested in both enron 's share of the teesside power station and enron direct ( a retail arm ) at the right price , " a spokesman at innogy told reuters .
enron has a 50 percent share in the 1,875 megawatt gas - fired teesside power station in north - east england , an investment which analysts say could be worth about 250 million pounds .
analysts said teesside , which came on stream in 1992 , could be an attractive buy as it has constant income .
teesside has a fairly steady revenue stream thanks to its power purchase agreement , but that is likely to run out in about 2008 so the station 's prospects after then will be less attractive , " an analyst who declined to be named said .
enron direct is likely to be snapped up , " said david kurtz , an analyst at datamonitor , who thought another potential buyer aside from innogy 's retail arm npower would be powergen .
of greater concern , additional litigation revolving around dyn 's aborted merger appears likely , potentially creating unquantifiable financial liabilities .
per my earlier email and the one below , could you please let us know about the 2000 defintions ?

steve , thanks for the update .
i am very sorry for your loss .
as you will note in the last paragraph , he is basically staking out a position that eecc is going to have to spend $ 2 million on project management software development and that he can capture free optionality of doing a deal with infrastructure world .
if there is a seperate carve - out of project management software that is required for what we do that is separate from what existing functionality of cepren , buzzsaw and bidcom is doing ; we may have an opportunity to do joint development with any of these players .
the question is picking who we think would be a winner and figuring out if there is a deal to be done .
allan and drew , together with the eecc , have orchestrated meetings next week with these three companies to figure out ways that eecc may be able to work together with one of them .
it is obviously not my call as to whether eecc needs or will spend $ 2 million for project management software development ( although i am skeptical ) .
from an investment perspective , there has not been that much that has progressed on infrastructure world in the last six to eight weeks .
the principal change has been a significant revaluation and critical assessment of b2b business plans and particularly revenue models .
i would say that the probability would be 25 % of $ 5 to $ 10 million with significant risk of doing subsequent rounds .
i would thus have a view that we should pass from an investment perspective .
thank you for talking to the trader at williams .

traders said power prices were rising with the return of heavier weekday loads and uncertainty over whether or not all generation currently available will be operating after the weekend .
trades spanned a tight range of $ 41.50-$42.00 , with most deals completed on the lower end , marketers said .
east central area reliability council traders said the cinergy market opened at $ 44.00 on the strength of yesterday 's next - week market , then rose to the day 's high amid buying pressure from marketers .
however , traders said with recent inaccurate weather forecasts , the market could either rise or fall next week .
lexington , massachusetts - based weather services corp. predicted high temperatures would be 89 degrees fahrenheit in nashville and 91 degrees in new orleans monday .
on the new orleans - based entergy corp. grid , for - monday power sold $ 10.72 higher on average , with the market opening at $ 51.00 and trading down to $ 41.00 after options expiration .
if that were to happen again , things could very well take off , because we 'd be getting into gas to meet the load we 're expecting , " he said .
in the spot market , week - ahead prices gained ground following heavy buying interest by few counter parties indicating a potential power plant outage , traders said , although this could not be confirmed .
although forecasts are drier for next week , it 's a good opportunity for participants holding an excess of contracts to sell them at very profitable prices , ' ' a stockholm - based trader said earlier today .

workshop this is great news for me and even more so for icbi(or the other way around .. ) .
any thoughts on whether we should give in with respect to the consequential damages issue ?
two additional points ; i believe it is best for us to move to replace the deemed isda agreement .
we should be able to settle a isda master agreement quite swiftly using the existing commmercial terms in the deemed isda .
if you are concur with this course of action we will forward to you tomorrow a schedule for review .
we would be most happy to provide a letter that you could aknowledge that the deemed isda agreement is a master agreement for the purposes of the eta .
i would prefer not to make a formal amendment as this may exclude a subsequent master agreement from applying .
excluding " consequential loss " in this circumstance is quite broad but if we could work through some scenarios hopefully we could find some words to accomodate your concerns .
when we last spoke you mentioned the concern here was the possibility that the password may be disclosed from other than a ue source
hence the source of the password must be the relevant counterparty .
perhaps you would give me a call so we may discuss any outstanding points .
call on this would have been a good idea .
once the office formally is opened , we will look forward to inviting you and others from the legal group over to meet the people who will be resident in this office and have a look around , but for the moment i just want you to know of this development as we announce it publicly .
please feel free at any time to let me know if you have any questions .
out with the old and in with the new !

i also need the agreed upon commission rate agreed between mike and monument .
however , he added that revenue might be slightly better than his projections and oracle 's continued improvement with operating margins should lead to earnings of $ 0.11 to $ 0.12 per share . ?
richard davis at needham & co. told clients recently that this quarter would be fine but still downgraded oracle 's stock because of the departure of bloom and senior vice president ray lane reduces the company 's earnings visibility and may encourage others to leave the company as well .
mr. upin said that oracle could have a tough february quarter and could see its toughest test of its performance in the applications space in the may quarter .

i realize these counterparties can pick up at malin however , i thought it would be useful to have these accounts set up in case they are unable or unwilling to pick up at malin .

hopefully the lawyer can figure out a way to speed things up .
you have to be reasonably careful about such choices since you will be spending your holiday in pretty close contact with them .
it might be best if our next staff meeting we discussed these - with appropriate caution ... i did pass around a copy of operations objectives michael moran 01/26/2000

hi kelly , sorry i have n't gotten back to you sooner , but have been swamped .
joe , in april last year we submitted a copy of the attached work plan to your office .
i believe your office forwarded the plan on to your austin office for review .
the scope of the work plan has been completed .
can you please advise either way .
hi jeff , i do n't know if you are picking up email , but just in case , here 's a description of the roundtable .
attached for you review is a first draft of a purchase and sale agreement for project 20/20 .
because the letter of intent for project 20/20 identifies several issues that will require further negotiation with northern border , i assumed we would follow the same approach for this transaction and negotiate those issues with northern border and then execute the purchase and sale agreement at the closing .
if northern border now wishes to execute the purchase and sale agreement before closing , we will need to complete our negotiations of the open issues and add the appropriate preclosing provisions to this draft , including closing conditions .
these are the kind of comments we need in deal entry for a record on deals that require special handling .
just a quick note to say sorry for getting off of the phone so quickly yesterday !
i think i 've used it like twice in the year i 've lived here !
or if you said i could call back after a certain time .
i thought i remembered that you could n't talk to me the rest of the day .
hope you 're having a great day !
i 'm glad you got in touch ...
i had an update to do for you anyway based on recent events .
the senate is moving forward with their bankruptcy legislation , and it will likely pass today or tomorrow .
the senate bill will include our technical correction on production payments , but will not include any doi language ( which is good ) or our derivatives changes ( which is not the best result , but ok ) .
according to most sources , the house folks have a much better handle on the financial contracts / derivatives issues and they will take the lead in making some technical changes to that title in conference .
the bond market folks have already presented a package of non - controversial technical corrections for inclusion in conference , and i think they would be amendable to adding our changes to their package .
i 'll continue to see if there are other suggested approaches .
in meeting earlier this year at treasury with mark haedicke , assistant secretary lee sachs indicated they would be amendable to talking about other ways of solving the " regularly " problem , so the lines of communciation are open .
hope things are going well with you and your family .
our traders want very much to be able to use master netting agreements with certain of their counterparties and we are currently exploring the possibility of accommodating them , subject to the bankruptcy concerns that we may have .
notice identifying the new gca rates will be posted on > this website upon puc final approval .
if there 's other stuff you need , or if you 'd like to discuss , do n't hesitate .
can you please check with alan to see if jennifer has completed , or will complete , the analysis soon ?
it has been some time since i reviewed the solar noncompete , but i believe it could bind a successor if a third party merged or consolidated with enron corp. , as opposed to a stock or asset purchase .

ford 's fourth - quarter results will improve from the third quarter but " it will be difficult to earn a profit during the quarter , " chief financial officer martin inglis said on a conference call .
office depot said fourth - quarter profit may be 3 cents to 5 cents a share below the 20-cent average estimate of analysts .
what that has done is to perfect the pricing mechanism - it has flattened out some of the volatility from the market .
however , senior traders said that once volumes started to increase on screens , electronic turnovers could explode - as had happened on other exchanges .
that could force the issue for the lme as it continued to offer three methods of trading - screens , telephones and open - outcry .
incentives traders said open - outcry trading would wither away unless the lme acted to make it more attractive to existing participants and potential new entrants .

traders and brokers said they hope dynegy will offer some kind of guarantee to enron 's trading to restore confidence .
but , after enron 's ability to transact took a severe turn for the worse nov. 20 , dynegy said that the companies must continue to operate independently until their merger is approved and completed .
for the first time since enron 's troubles began a month ago , energy companies stopped selling to enron in the spot markets for fear that enron might not be able to pay its bills as soon as next month based on the quarterly filing .
the buyout offer , finalized nov. 9 , would have had dynegy paying about $ 10.41 for each share of enron , but enron 's shares have since cratered to near $ 4 , stoking investor fears the merger will not go through as planned - if at all .
i can confirm that we are in discussions with the parties involved in the transaction related to the structure of a deal , " dynegy spokesman steve stengel said .
as the market waits for more details from the two companies , some say it will take more than a revised offer to provide takeover traders , also known as arbitrageurs , with enough confidence to play the deal in the typical fashion .
in this way , the traders hope to profit as the target 's share price moves toward the buyer 's offer .
enron had hoped to finalise the deal and make an announcement yesterday that would calm investors -- the shares are trading at a small fraction of their record high last year of 87.50 usd .
the market sees this and somebody has to figure out the potential exposure , it could be several billion dollars , " said gheit .
still , reports that the equity swap ratio offered by dynegy could be revised down to below 0.15 from 0.2685 , has some hedge funds , often willing to take more risks , looking to place trades on the deal .
we 're trying to figure out a good play , " said a trader at a new york hedge fund .
some bids are coming in , especially on the lower priced bonds , " said a trader at a large new york investment bank that makes a market in enron 's bonds .
at the same time it has become much easier to hedge that loss potential by going long on enron bonds .
but the situation is so volatile that it 's difficult to be aggressive , " the manager of a large new york hedge fund said .
new york -(dow jones)- dynegy inc. ( dyn ) confirmed the company is in talks with a number of parties regarding the structure of its transaction with
i can confirm that we are in discussions with the parties involved in the transaction related to the structure of the deal , " said john sousa .
by 2002 , enron field may need a new name .
soon enron may be part of dynegy , a much smaller company in terms of revenue .

erin , a book by martha amram and nalin kulatilaka is an excellent non - technical introduction to real options and it contains all the most important references to more advanced books and papers .
we still have a few binders with the presentation materials available if you are interested .
the real options approach has been developed specifically to address the problem of making investment decisions under uncertainty .
nobody in this field claims that this is a perfect tool , but it represents a significant progress compared to other techniques developed earlier .
the real , option approach is very powerful because it allows to ( 1 ) capture uncertainty in an explicit way and ( 2 ) to design investment projects that allow to exploit future positive developments and reduce future exposures to downside risk .
this approach allows also create a link between investment decisions and future operational decisions .
forward - looking investment decisions create options that are exercised in the future through active management of a project .
the real options technology relies heavily on advanced statistical tools to come up with the representation of future possible states of the world .
it is especially critical to stress - test the assumptions of any model and to ask the question if the outcome of a model depends critically on any set of assumptions .

hi mark , i have not met you yet but heard a lot of good things about you .
also ; you will notice that from peak on through 24 , the pool has been strong .
now that i have analyzed this project with my it hat on , i would like to suggest that we enlist the services of a business analyst from enron net works .
we do have a technical team ( 2 members ) from enw , but they are focused on the architecture and design of the system and might inadvertantly miss some of the user - specific issues involved with a roll - out of this magnitude .
enw will have ultimate responsiblity for deploying backweb and it would be in their best interests to assign a business analyst at the front end .
we have to keep field personnel in mind with a project of this scope , and the business units will understand the unique issues of their own users much better than we at corp could hope to do .
the windows 2000 teams at each business unit would probably have the most suitable people to commit to this project , as they have so recently undertaken a similar deployment .
i want to be sure we are including everyone who should be involved .
courtney and i can certainly speak to the requirements for corp , but i do n't want to presume to speak for ees or ets .
i talked to your mom just after new years - sounds like you guys had fun in fernie .

i just recently made my transition and i am exploring what direction i would like to take within the corporate arena .

i 'm normally not a big fan of conferences , but this one may be of interest .
i think it may be of even more interest if we do n't speak : it 's possible some utilities may say some of the same things we would say , but they may be less likely to do so if we speak and they feel they have to respond .

he has the ability to make plays .
on nebraska tight end tracy wistrom tracy does a great job .
he 's got excellent speed for a tight end .
on keeping the teams emotions down and not overpursuing plays on defense like they did last year in the first quarter against nebraska we 've had a lot of big games since then as well , and the experience in that game will help them .
i think at that time we were coming off an off - week that also may or may not have been a factor .
i think our players are much more seasoned in this type of atmosphere today then they were at that time last year .
yes , but i felt he was a good thrower last year .
i imagine , like anybody with another year of experience , he 's better at it this year
i 'm sure this will be as equal as any .
we understand that , but i also think it has a way of exciting and has your team ready as well .
this game has not only determined the conference championship , but you look at both these schools with 12 national championships between them and so many times , whoever has the conference championship has a chance to compete for the national championship .
on if he will use films from old oklahoma - nebraska games to inspire the team like he did last year i think it 's important that our players truly understand the traditional and history of this game and respect it .
i think it 's good that they know and understand as much about their program as they can .
i wanted them to realize that they could .
i believe it gave us the attitude or it helped us with the attitude to go into the football game and feel confident that we 're ready for this .
watching great players on the field that the whole country knew about .
probably so , if both teams are able to win out and meet in the championship game .
i would imagine that would have a chance to happen .
on the possibility of scheduling nebraska during the years ou does not play them in conference play i do n't know how you could unless you want to change the league and how you play the games .
i do n't know how the setup would work .
on how much jason white 's experience playing in a big game against texas will help against nebraska
i think it will help him greatly .
i believe he 'll handle it well .
that 's what you feel good about .
on if he feels good about nebraska having played in more big games this season
and after the game , win or lose , they say " good game " , " good luck " and generally defy what you come to expect from having been to many of the other places we play .
i hope , though , that it will be another of those great games for all the country to see .
and i hope , too , that we can have a rematch come december in dallas .
in his 19 years as an ou assistant coach , he helped the sooners build a 150 - 67 - 5 record , win a national championship and five big eight conference titles and post seven bowl game victories .

in order to speak in detail on dena 's proposal , kline said he would need to see an actual contract , which has yet to materialize .
kline said that sdg&e would need to compare dena 's offer with those received or accepted from other energy suppliers to know if it represents a good deal for sdg&e customers .
dena has also proceeded with building new generation in the state .
securing sdg&e customers under these factors would be a major coup for dena in the california market , but how it stacks up against sdg&e 's other unnamed offers remains to be seen .
i am ok with this so long as it does not set a precedent for next year .

i spoke with george today about whether enron would be amenable to discussing settlement with sempra and putting the facilities to work on a " going forward " basis while continuing the fight over past breaches .
george said that we would be interested but this interest was subject to the following general caveats : ( 1 ) we would like the facilities moved to one of the sites we are currently trying to get permitted which would be more convenient for us , and ( 2 ) we want to renegotiate certain portions of the contracts to reflect today 's market situation .
with that in mind , do you have any thoughts about the most effective way to facilitate these discussions ?
and i think we should try to avoid having holmes and gittomer sitting opposite from george and wayne with goldstein and i in the background looking for cover .
in the alternative , would it be a good idea to involve you and mel ?
on a slightly related note , i agree that we probably need to get a mitigation letter out
but i do n't necessarily want to send the one we had been discussing .
we will take a look at it and get back to you .

natural gas futures scooted higher in active trading friday on the new york mercantile exchange .
prices opened lower but modest buying by fund and managed accounts was more than enough to whet the appetite of local and short term traders anxious to ferret out buy stops above the market .
early on there was good fund buying in the $ 2.52 to $ 2.53 area .
there was not a great deal of fund buying but some , " said a new york floor trader . . .

while critics have called the agency an unnecessary new bureaucracy , its five members could have a profound impact on the state 's energy future .
they have up to $ 5 billion to spend and are expected to soon begin signing contracts to provide financing for companies that want to build so - called peaker plants , which would be used when electricity supplies are low .
the authority also will reserve the right to eventually own the plants -- meaning the state 's role in energy markets would continue long into the future .
the state would offer financing for the plants , which would be run by the companies .
the plants would be built by next summer .
that would be my hope , " bilas said .
in a letter sent wednesday to ferc chairman pat wood , jones called for the commission to investigate " possible significant price and market manipulation of electrical energy by several energy - related entities in the administration of california 's gov. gray davis .
giving state - bought power priority energy : proposal could force distribution of more - expensive electricity purchased by california department of water resources .
dwr spokesman oscar hidalgo said such surpluses would happen infrequently because the department also has short - term contracts that can be adjusted to reduce the amount of electricity the state must buy .
he predicted the upper house would probably make changes of its own and send a new version of the bill back to the assembly for a final vote by sept. 14 , the deadline to pass legislation this year .
the company accumulated its huge debt last year and early this year when it had to buy electricity on the open market for far more than it could charge its customers under a state - imposed rate freeze .
however , the utility will still need to raise about $ 1 billion to pay large generators .
we 're encouraged by the forward progress the assembly vote represents toward creating a workable framework to get the state out of the power procurement business and restore us to credit worthiness , " said bob foster , edison international senior vice president .
the state is also buying power for a third investor - owned utility , san diego gas & electric , which is in better financial shape than much larger edison and pg&e but is also struggling with high wholesale power costs .
the commission also will vote on raising rates for san diego gas & electric customers .
angelides said in a statement that his office will release a revised timetable for bond issuance only after the puc has acted on all the items , indicating that the deal could possibly be postponed again if the puc continues to delay voting on critical matters .
this approval of the agreements will display to the financial community that we are moving forward on ab 1x , but i think ab 1x was a mistake .
duque expressed his hopes for passage of a senate bill currently under consideration that would show the dwr set - aside on customer 's utility bills .
however , delays to address the complex issues prior to selling the bonds will help ensure a more successful bond sale , according to david blair , a senior analyst at
there has n't been a large new issue in california in the last few weeks , so it 's a great time to bring in a new deal .
more than $ 300 million of the proceeds will be used to fund school facility improvements .
when california sold gos last june it was forced to pay 25 basis points above the triple - a scale on bonds due in 30 years , but the sale was considered a success because some had feared the state would have to pay as much as 30 basis points more to sell the bonds .
as much as the state may try to detach the power bonds from more normal financing plans , investors are looking at both , another investment analyst said .
in looking at the state 's outlook , you have to look at some of the risks it faces in resolving the power crisis .
the department also has sufficient funds available to purchase power for the rest of the fiscal year .
the rating reflects the potential for additional general - fund purchases if the current power bond plan falls through and electricity prices rise , the possible long - term detrimental effect on the state 's economy of retail electric rate hikes , and possible further rate increases to recapitalize the state 's insolvent investor - owned utilities .
the bill originated in the state senate but has been extensively amended by assembly committees and the current version is much more favorable to the utility than the one cleared by the senate in a tight 22 - 17 vote last month .
that meeting 's agenda will also include several items that establish the legal framework for the state to move ahead with a record sale of $ 12.5 billion in power purchase bonds .
the regulators have delayed votes on both issues since early this year while they have held hearings and prepared the complex measures needed to get the bond issue under way .
the proceeds from the tax would be returned to californians through an annual holiday from state sales taxes during the first weekend in december .
the cpuc hopes to vote on all outstanding items related to the bond sale sept. 13 , lynch said thursday .
those votes were also needed to move the bond sale forward .
and i need to be in a position to send out preliminary info late wednesday or early thursday to interested parties .

chevron will be renamed chevrontexaco and will trade on the new york stock exchange under the new ticker symbol cvx .
next year , the new company will place its headquarters in suburban san ramon ,
the new company will have a leadership position in power generation .
in addition , the sheer size of the new company should allow it to better cope with fluctuating crude prices and provide a greater ability to undertake global projects that are growing in complexity , size and cost .
after gaining enormous size through mergers in recent years , these two companies have seen their shares return about 70 percent and 80 percent , respectively .
as mentioned earlier , in terms of market capitalization , the new company will rank second among u.s. energy companies , and fourth among global energy companies , with a market capitalization approaching $ 100 billion .
so , it is not inconceivable that the merger could reduce costs perhaps up to twice as much as currently projected , and that would translate into earnings for next year and beyond being much higher than anticipated .
initial feedback on enron being part of the solution was very positive by the business owner of the rearchitecture .
apparently , there is a significant process flow rework going on at the same time and the business owner reports to the ceo on both topics .

i strongly suggest we put in place a similar system for transmission credits whereby we receive tva signoff as part of the process dennis
please follow up with jody , amy , and lloyd to make sure everyone is up to speed on this as we proceed , and please make sure that an adequate process is set up to account for transmission charges , credits , and balance of shelby upgrade costs .
tim , thanks for the feedback .
i have to leave work early tomorrow at 5 p.m. for an appointment .

i would n't want to do a discount because of " full rate equivalent " issues .
2 ) i could create a tariff exception on the oneok contract for the days in question , setting the overrun rate equal to the firm rate .
joe informed me that for the activity that had already been scheduled as overrun prior to that date could n't be changed without a lot of work and it would be easier for me just to put in an overrun discount to get the invoice to come out correctly .

however , he said , such a plan , by increasing production , would help bring down energy prices -- which in turn would benefit consumers and industries that use large amounts of energy .
at the end of the day , our members are helped when you have a healthy , strong economy and their customers are doing well , " cavaney said .
it would create jobs and much - needed energy .
the teamsters , for example , would benefit from proposed pipeline construction in alaska .
likewise , the united mine workers could win from increased coal production , and an array of construction unions would profit from the building of new power plants and transmission systems .
yet among the first to benefit from the plan would be
power plant engineering companies , an industry dominated by such california - based companies as the southland 's fluor corp. , parsons corp. and jacobs engineering , along with san francisco 's bechtel corp. mark stevens , head of strategic planning at aliso viejo - based fluor , said he huddled with staff members thursday to figure out where the bush plan could mean increased business for the company .
in alaska , the company is already at work on " front - end engineering " for the planned natural gas pipeline that will bring gas from prudhoe bay to alberta , canada .
the energy department 's research and development budget for renewables was cut 50 % in bush 's budget request , and the industry was disappointed that the plan did not include a commitment to restore or increase federal investment to help level the playing field between renewables and other energy sources .
we 're still looking for the missing chapter on climate change , " said jeremy symons of the national wildlife federation .
the auto industry might get a boost from the plan 's provision for tax credits for purchasing hybrid - powered cars and trucks , but not soon .
the benefits will go to relatively few consumers at the start .
i do n't want that to happen in japan .
it may work when you discuss the company 's management and all that , but when you handle daily operations , you ca n't wait for problems or issues to go up to the management before they can be sorted out . '
on the supply side also , developers like the rahejas , ajmeras and hiranandanis are already on the drive in developing areas like malad link road , andheri ( w ) & kandivali and powai , respectively .
in a move aimed at promoting start - up infotech ventures in the state , the maharashtra government has announced the formation of samruddhi venture park .
the project aims to provide complete assistance to start - up ventures under one roof .
i do n't want to see that happen in japan . '
liberalization in japan would help manufactures save an annual 4 trillion yen and help them to better compete with global rivals , said nicholas j. o'day , enron japan corp. 's vice president of public affairs .
the new energy policy announced by the president thursday calls for building between 1,300 and 1,900 new power plants , thousands of miles of new pipelines and new oil refineries over the next 20 years .
among those in the energy business , the plan drew broad approval , even though some worried about a tilt toward the supply side .

jones)- those looking for even the slightest bit of good news for the state of california can find it in friday 's san jose mercury news .
with market observers expecting stocks to be flat or range - bound for a while as the economy gropes toward a recovery , these investors were selling options to generate income upfront and hoping the sold contracts will expire unexercised .
because options volatility already had fallen significantly , some investors think it is risky to sell options - selling volatility in trader speak - at this time , since a sudden stock selloff could trigger anxiety and raise option premium and make it more costly to buy back these sold options .
but with no major economic events on the calendar until well into june , and with a long holiday weekend coming up later this months , investors also are wary about being long volatility .
an institutional investor bought more than 5,000 contracts of the june 55 calls and sold a roughly equal number of the june 50 puts to help offset the cost .
we are delighted to have been selected to participate in both core venture 1 and core venture 3 " .
we look forward to playing a constructive role in the establishment of the saudi natural gas industry .
the u.s. energy department on friday welcomed saudi arabia 's decision to award contracts to several large american energy firms to help develop the kingdom 's vast natural gas resources , and said the move fits in with the bush administration 's new comprehensive energy plan .
we 're pleased that these american firms have been chosen to lead these natural gas development projects , " energy secretary spencer abraham said through a department spokeswoman .
this decision is right on target with the president 's energy plan ... that identifies the opening up of energy producing countries to foreign investment , an important way to broaden our shared commercial and strategic interests , " abraham said .
the spokeswoman said it is too early to determine if abraham would travel to saudi arabia for the formal signing of memorandums of understanding ( mous ) for the projects , which will take place in a few weeks .
the awards mark the biggest advance in the kingdom 's efforts to develop its gas reserves , the world 's fourth largest , since riyadh unveiled the energy opening more than two years ago .
we are delighted to have been selected to participate in both core venture 1 and core venture 3 , " group chairman mark moody - stuart said in a company statement .
the consortium selected to develop the south ghawar project - core venture 1 , estimated at $ 15 billion - was awarded to exxonmobil , royal dutch / shell ( rd ) , bp amoco ( bp ) and
once the mou 's are signed , a clearer outline of what form the projects will take will begin and a comprehensive project development program will be " signed " by the end of this year , the source added .
the saudis may leave it to the project leaders to direct negotiations with its consortium members on how to divide up both the stakes and management of the whole project .
finally , the source said that the project drafts received by the companies selected friday , were more detailed and constructive than expected at this stage .
no leader has yet been selected either for venture three , the shaybah area development deal in which shell will be grouped with total fina elf and conoco or -- most critically -- the giant south ghawar project , eig reports in the latest issue of its energy intelligence briefing service .
initial agreements defining the scope and duration of the projects are to be finalized over the next two weeks , with signing due early next month .
bp and phillips are unlikely to be selected for the leadership role at south ghawar , eig understands .
the choice at core area 1 may depend in part on the decision in core area 3 , where any one of the three partners could yet be selected as operator .
conoco has the advantage of being the first one to propose a project in the area .
the site is perfect for both eig 's clients and newcomers looking for the best business intelligence on the world of oil and gas .
the site combines the high quality news , analysis and data you expect from eig with cutting - edge internet technology .
saudi arabia announced its choices of international oil companies from both sides of the atlantic for three huge natural - gas projects , marking the reopening of its energy sector to western investment , a quarter century after it was nationalized .
together , the three projects will require investment of some $ 25 billion .
no decision has yet been made on who will lead core venture 1 , also called the ghawar project after the world 's largest onshore oil field .
exxon mobil , leader of core venture 2 , the only project for which a leader was announced friday , said in a written statement that the project includes development of discovered gas resources in northwest saudi arabia , power and desalination facilities in that region and exploration in the northern red sea with the opportunity for additional investment in chemicals , power and desalination facilities on the west coast .
exxon mobil also hopes to become project leader for core venture 1 , which will expand saudi arabia 's power , water desalination , petrochemical and gas systems and provide for exploration and development of gas resources in the northern rub al - khali region .
while the projects initially involve gas , the winners will have a lead should the country open access to its crude oil reserves , the world 's largest .
the south ghawar project is the centerpiece of the kingdom 's plan and will include irving , texas - based exxon mobil , shell , bp and phillips , spa said .
shell , conoco and total were chosen for the shaybah project , which may cost $ 4 billion .
the country needs foreign investment to help create enough jobs for the 100,000 men entering the market each year .
` ` the spin - off benefit will be the creation of thousands of new jobs for saudis . '
bj services co. ` ` this is the most significant development possible for the oilfield - services industry , outside of burgeoning new activity off angola and brazil , ' '
i think it is a relatively easy task to achieve the synchronization with houston 's exotica options library .
we can routinely ship the excutable whenever we update the library for installation in london .
at the end of the day , it is enron 's p / l , different versions of exotica would produce a small difference in per unit basis , however , this difference could be amplified to a large discrepency due to the large trade volumes .
while it is nice to have a c++ version , but we think it should be assigned a low priority .
when we looked into it , it seemed like a relatively minor issue .
hi bjorn , some time ago we , you , stinson and i , had a meeting in houston regarding having the same versions for houston and london .
first , thank you for your generosity this holiday season , especially during this difficult time .

jones)- pg&e corp ( pcg ) is re - evaluating how much new generation it will build in future years due to declining market demand and the impact of utility pacific gas and electric co 's bankrutpcy , company executives said on an earnings call with analysts monday .
that 's still being evaluated so we ca n't give new projections , but it 's likely to be less than 22,000 mw .
the company will proceed with the construction of current projects worth 5,400 mw , and tolling arrangements worth 2,200 , boren added .
we are not cancelling development projects at this time , and we are also moving forward with construction of the north baja ( natural gas ) pipeline , " boren said .

as there is no transfer of utility facility , i would n't think there would be a necessity for additional filings ( i.e. section 851 or 377 ) .
in fact , ratepayers may be better off in the long - run because the new facilities would be much more efficient than the existing facilities .
i would assume the new facilities ' emissions would be lower .
if we could get a copy of the analyst 's report , it would be very helpful .

thanks a million for all your efforts .
to the discussion i would add the following - 1 .
moreover , in markets like ercot , the zonal structure has been co - opted by the large incumbents to frustrate the development of the market .
our goal is to work within the rto process and build markets that work for enron .
i agree with tim that it is very difficult to come up with " one " perfect market structure proposal for enron ( both for technical and timing reasons - california is in a different place than spp ) .
please contact her if anyone from your teams should attend .
i have asked steve to flesh out more details of the nodal approach -- in particular , how do the nodes map to a fairly homogeneous zone and how does this impact pure trading positions ( i.e. , a transaction with no asset being directly scheduled to support it ) versus asset - based trades where the meter must settle with the rto while the trade settles with the market .
it may be that the physical characteristics of the east and west warrant different models .
for example , the west has large , long - distance , high voltage lines that are very amenable to a zonal approach .
the east has more local transmission bottlenecks that may not be modeled as easily .
it also could be that the political reality in the east and west require different positions .
finally , it could be that the east desk and the west desk have a difference of opinion on what the " ideal " market structure should be .
given the different advocacy positions in the east and the west , i do n't think that we can come up with a broad , nationwide advocacy position at this time .
instead , i think that we should focus on the objectives that rto 's should try to achieve and be flexible as to what the best market structure should be to achieve these objectives .

although i have stressed the relative ease of the first phase of rt tagging , i encourage everyone to do as much as you can now .
the more effort you put into the process and understanding of rt tagging now , the better off we will be later .
if a counterparty does not want to do a trade because they do n't want to tag it , offer to do the tag for them .

summer price spikes in california seem to be lower than spot market situations that occasionally occur in the midwest and in the new york area .
once again opportunists have twisted a good idea into a profitable venture for a very small group .
as a market moves up the supply curve on peak , there is no doubt that there is more supplier concentration , and the potential for market manipulation .
a better long - term solution will be encourage more competition by identifying and removing barriers to new peaking and base load generation , particularly distributed generation , that can be located in load centers to serve peak loads .
that answer should depend on when the promised market - in - equilibrium can be brought to bear , and when a workable western rto can guarantee economic transmission rates for california consumers .
at any cost , it will be cheaper than where we 're heading .
so how many will want to build in this " market , " with this new and highly volatile form of risk ?
part of what ferc intended with the implementation of wholesale deregulation was for the market to send accurate price signals to the supply side so they would be motivated to develop and innovate new forms of supply and demand side management .
the price caps tarnish the allure of investing in new generating capacity and the incentive for electricity buyers to plan ahead more effectively .
when enough new generators join in , the market will reach equilibrium .
transition to a restructured system is going to take more than a few years .
in the meantime , dealing with system peak loads is where attention should be focused .

the problem is that it 's a long - term effort that requires a lot of patience and a significant investment of time and human capital .
i think that the academic community can play an important role in shaping public opinion and in explaining the logic of deregulation process .
i 'll stop pestering you and greg about this , but i 'm very concerned that you may win the battle for competitive energy markets , but lose the war because the public at large does n't see where or how they can benefit from enron 's market - making innovations .

sooner would be better than later .

the new subgroup , in effect , replaced the larger group and we have worked together through the year as specific , focused needs arose .
mark mueller from ees was very helpful in our initial discussions but he said ees was several months away from any viable business strategy or regulatory needs .
it was a good way for people across the organization and on different continents to get to know one another .
( personally , i know it was valuable for me to say in a couple of customer presentations , that enron is the only retailer where i could , when faced with a problem , instantly have people on the phone with experience from 5 different continents who could help solve the problem . )
i think it is more effective to organize activity around specific needs and bring people together to perform the function as needed .
we had high attendance and good participation from the rest of the team .
jeff -- just a brief note -- i know that you are busy on a lot of different fronts .
i am wondering about your plans for xcelerator .
the xcelerator has decided to take on this opportunity and will be moving mathis conner and peter feltman , the two people from our group who developed the concept , into the xcelerator team this week .
the xcelerator group seems to have some good talent for evaluating ideas , but i got the sense that they are looking for folks with more implementation experience who can help them drive ideas into execution .
in fact , a couple of them wanted to know if david and i are available and interested in coming over to the xcelerator .
based on what i know about xcelerator , david and i seem to have a good background and skill set for what the group is doing .
i do n't have any knowledge of what you might have planned for xcelerator , so i do n't want to pursue anything that might be distracting to the team .
your feedback would be most appreciated .
using these prices , it will determine whether a unit at a particular location will be dispatched or not depending on a ) spread of power and fuel prices , and b ) whether the start - up cost can be recovered during 8 operation hours .
the unit can be dispatched at minimum and peak levels .
unless we convert the algorithm to c , i do n't see how spreadsheet can handle more simulations .
but in view of the great wall of china separating the business units , should we do it ?
it can use forward - forward vol and incorporate seasonality into it ( i understand this is debatable ) .
since most of the time - cost occurs in price simulation , and we are to simulate about 20 price processes , i hope the full model ( if we build it ) will take a couple of hours to run for 200 units .
this is where i need most help if i am to do it .

us second quarter growth is unlikely to be much more than the first quarter 's 1.3 % .
i would not be surprised to see the nasdaq try and test if not fill wednesday 's gap at 2170.58 on thursday .
nevertheless , this week 's trendline breakout along with the downturn by momentum indicators strongly suggests that additional weakness into early - june appears likely .
momentum indicators are turning neutral warning traders to use caution as a short - term low may be in or near .
the energy markets were mostly lower in overnight trading as worries about refiner 's ability to meet summer driving demand continue to abate .
closes below last week 's low at 28.10 would confirm the recent breakout below this spring 's uptrend line .
multiple closes below this support level would open the door for a test of may 's reaction low crossing at 91.20 later this spring .
multiple closes below this support level would opened the door for a possible test of fib support crossing at 3.64 later this spring .
however , momentum indicators have become extremely oversold warning bears to use caution as a corrective bounce is possible .
the september euro posted a new low for the year overnight and has broken out below last november 's low crossing at 85.00 .
nevertheless , momentum indicators are turning neutral to bullish , which suggests that a short - term low might be in place .
i am looking for sideways trading to continue into the early - part of june .
a lower close during the day session would confirm the recent breakout below last october 's low crossing at .5643 while opening the door for a possible test of weekly support crossing at .5488 later this year .
the adx ( a trend - following indicator ) has entered a bearish trend mode signaling that sideways to lower prices into june are possible .
the september japanese yen was lower in narrow trading overnight as it continues to consolidate below trading range resistance that crosses at .8425 .
closes above.8483 are needed to confirm an upside breakout of this spring 's trading range .
precious metals august comex gold was lower overnight but is working on a possible inside day following wednesday 's sharp loss and spike below april 's uptrend line crossing near 267.50 .
multiple closes below the uptrend line would confirm a breakout while opening the door for a test of this spring 's low crossing at 257.30 later this year .
however , momentum indicators have turned bearish signaling that additional weakness near - term is possible .
july 's inability to post a short covering bounce on wednesday underscores the weak tone of the market as the door is open for additional weakness and a possible test of may 's low at 74.75 later this spring .
traders are expecting to see the usda to lower their export projection for this year in the upcoming june supply / demand report .
cool / wet weather across the western corn belt continues to slow early crop development however , the latest planting progress report shows that 95 % of the crop has been planted making this a non - issue .
the recent breakout below weekly support crossing at 1.91 1/2 has opened the door for a possible test of last summer 's low crossing at 1.74 1/2 later this year .
light support came from light position squaring ahead of the release of this morning 's export sales report and news that japan bought 100,000 metric tonnes of july wheat .
demand remains strong , which should force the usda to raise this years export projection in the june supply / demand report .
a short covering bounce on thursday is possible if today 's export sales report comes in at or above expectations .
more technical damage was inflicted by the bears as prices hit another fresh three - week low , as there was follow - through selling from friday 's gap - lower trade .
with regard to a summary of your olympic research in other jurisdictions , i would very much appreciate a summary .
gaming advice in the various eu jurisdictions thank you for your e - mails .
i set out below the advice we have received from the various jurisdictions .
countries that could possibly be added to the approved list , provided certain facts are confirmed ( with either enron or the regulatory authorites),and / or further information is provided .
it is my understanding , that this is the case - so assuming this is correct , poland could be added to the approved list .
our italian lawyers would like to know how many users there will be in italy , and would like us to confirm that the site will be in english and from a server located in the uk .
our swedish lawyers therefore need to know how many participants there are in sweden - if it is less than 250 , then there seems to be a good chance that the game can go ahead - but i will confirm this with them .
the tax issues are similar to those initially expressed by the finnish lawyers - and may fall away after consultation with the norwegian authorites .
i also have advice from the various jurisdictions relating to whether enron employees themselves can participate ( this looks favourable - obviously as long as the game is conducted fairly ) .
i will review the specifics of this advice , and forward it to you , along with the advice we have on disclaimers .
i should be able to do this this afternoon / evening ( uk time ) .
would you like a summary of this advice for future reference ? -
please review and let me know tomorrow if you should have any questions or comments .

costilla has sent in a new request , take a look and let me know .
there are clearly a large number of people who need to know what is happening on the integration of the mg metals business and a large number of fluid teams working on different aspects of the project ; however , most issues related to the integration process will only be of interest to a subset of the people involved .
a weekly meeting on friday mornings from 8 am to 9 am in nw1006 , which has been put in place to provide team leaders with an opportunity to update the entire integration team on their top two or three issues for the past and/or coming week .
presenters should attend if at all possible and , in the event they are unable to attend , should nominate a replacement for the meeting ( replacements should be notified to esther gerratt in advance of the friday morning meeting if possible ) .
lastly , i would request that presenters focus on communicating , in an efficient manner , things which affect other functions within the integration process .
i hope you find this useful .
we want to keep the information flowing as we continue the integration process , but at the same time we need to make sure we use our time wisely and efficiently .
